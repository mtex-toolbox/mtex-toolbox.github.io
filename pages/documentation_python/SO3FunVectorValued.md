<!--introduction-->

A scalar orientation function assigns one number to each orientation. A vector-valued
orientation function assigns an array of numbers instead:

$$ f\colon \mathrm{SO}(3) \to \mathbb{R}^n. $$

This is useful when several orientation-dependent quantities share the same nodes,
symmetries and approximation method. MTEX stores the components together so that they can
be interpolated and manipulated as one array of functions.

## How evaluations are arranged

The nodes come first in an evaluated array. The dimensions of the vector-valued `SO3Fun`
follow them.

Consider four nodes $$R_1,\ldots,R_4$$ and six scalar functions arranged as a
$$3\mathbin{\times}2$$ array. Evaluation returns an array $$F$$ of shape $$(4, 3, 2)$$:

$$ F[:,:,0]=\begin{pmatrix}
f_1(R_1)&f_2(R_1)&f_3(R_1)\\
f_1(R_2)&f_2(R_2)&f_3(R_2)\\
f_1(R_3)&f_2(R_3)&f_3(R_3)\\
f_1(R_4)&f_2(R_4)&f_3(R_4)
\end{pmatrix}, \qquad
F[:,:,1]=\begin{pmatrix}
f_4(R_1)&f_5(R_1)&f_6(R_1)\\
f_4(R_2)&f_5(R_2)&f_6(R_2)\\
f_4(R_3)&f_5(R_3)&f_6(R_3)\\
f_4(R_4)&f_5(R_4)&f_6(R_4)
\end{pmatrix}. $$

The harmonic coefficients are arranged the other way round: the last dimension of the
coefficient array stores all Fourier coefficients of one scalar function, and the function
array's dimensions come before it. This coefficient dimension is an implementation detail.
Indexing and `shape` report only the $$3\mathbin{\times}2$$ function array seen by the user.

## Interpolate several components from samples

First construct a list of approximately $$10^5$$ orientations. The crystal and specimen
symmetries determine the fundamental region sampled by the grid.

```python
import warnings

import numpy as np

from mtex import *

nodes = equispacedSO3Grid(crystalFrame(), specimenFrame(), points=1e5)
nodes = nodes.flatten()
```

The first value column samples the Dubna model function. The second is a different scalar
quantity evaluated at the same nodes. Assigning the Dubna crystal symmetry to the nodes
makes their symmetry agree with the sampled model.

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
y = np.stack([SO3Fun.dubna(rotation(nodes)), (nodes.a * nodes.b).astype(complex) ** (1 / 4)], axis=-1)
nodes = orientation(rotation(nodes), SO3Fun.dubna().CS, nodes.SS)
```

[SO3FunHarmonic.interpolate](SO3FunHarmonic.interpolate.html) fits both columns in one
call. The result is an array of two harmonic functions. Here the bandwidth is 48 and LSQR
is limited to 10 iterations.

```python
SO3F1 = SO3FunHarmonic.interpolate(nodes, y, maxit=10, bandwidth=48)
SO3F1
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (Quartz → y↑→x)
  size     : 2
  bandwidth: 48
  isReal   : false
```

The deliberately short iteration limit leaves the fit short of its optimum. Increase
`maxit` when convergence, rather than a compact teaching run, is required.

Evaluating four orientations demonstrates the layout directly: four rows are nodes and two
columns are components.

```python
SO3F1.eval(nodes[:4]).shape
```

```text
(4, 2)
```

The generic [interp](rotation.interp.html) route can instead build an
[SO3FunRBF](SO3FunRBF.SO3FunRBF.html) from one value column.

```python
SO3F2 = interp(nodes, np.real(y[:, 0]))
SO3F2
```

```text
SO3FunRBF (Quartz → y↑→x)
  multimodal components
    kernel: de la Vallee Poussin, halfwidth 5°
    center: 20040 orientations
    weight: 1.001
    Bunge Euler angles in degree
    phi1   Phi  phi2    weight
      90  2.49   210  5.76e-06
      90  2.49   215  3.69e-06
      90  2.49   220  2.78e-06
      90  2.49   225   5.1e-06
      90  2.49   230  5.88e-06
       ⋮     ⋮     ⋮         ⋮
     7.5  97.1   7.5  1.53e-06
    52.5  97.1   292   1.2e-05
    57.5  97.1   298  8.75e-06
    62.5  97.1   302  5.43e-06
    67.5  97.1   308  6.34e-06
```

This `interp` syntax is available only for a univariate, or scalar-valued, function. Use
the explicit harmonic interpolation above when several sampled components should remain
together.

## Construct a function from a Python function

Quadrature provides a second route when values can be evaluated at any orientation. The
function below returns four columns for every input orientation.

```python
f = lambda rot: np.stack([np.exp(rot.a + rot.b + rot.c) + 50 * (rot.b - np.cos(np.pi / 3)) ** 3 * (rot.b - np.cos(np.pi / 3) > 0),
                          rot.a, rot.b, rot.c], axis=-1)
```

[SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature](SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature.html) evaluates the function on a
quadrature grid. It creates an array of four harmonic functions with bandwidth 50 and the
same crystal symmetry as `SO3F1`.

```python
SO3F3 = SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature(f, SO3F1.CS, bandwidth=50)
SO3F3
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (Quartz → y↑→x)
  size     : 4
  bandwidth: 50
```

## Construct a function from Fourier coefficients

Known Fourier coefficients can be passed directly to the
[SO3FunHarmonic](SO3FunHarmonic.SO3FunHarmonic.html) constructor. Each row of the
coefficient matrix becomes one component.

```python
SO3F4 = SO3FunHarmonic(np.eye(10))
SO3F4
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (1 → y↑→x)
  size     : 10
  bandwidth: 1
  isReal   : false
```

This stores the first ten [Wigner-D functions](WignerFunctions_py.html) as an array of ten
functions. The coefficient dimension is hidden from the reported array size.

## Index and reshape components

Function arrays follow ordinary array conventions. They can be concatenated, indexed and
reshaped. Concatenating the two- and four-component arrays below produces six components,
and indexing selects components two through four.

```python
SO3F5 = SO3FunHarmonic.cat(SO3F1, SO3F3)
SO3F5[1:4]
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (Quartz → y↑→x)
  size     : 3
  bandwidth: 50
  isReal   : false
```

Transpose and conjugation act on the function array and its Fourier coefficients. The
transpose `T` changes only the array shape, whereas `conj(f).T` also conjugates complex
coefficients.

```python
conj(SO3F1)
SO3F1.T
conj(SO3F1).T
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (Quartz → y↑→x)
  size     : 2 × 1
  bandwidth: 48
  isReal   : false
```

Standard array queries report the component array dimensions.

```python
len(SO3F1)
```

```text
2
```

---

```python
SO3F3.shape
```

```text
(4,)
```

---

```python
SO3F4 = SO3F4.reshape(2, -1)
SO3F4
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (1 → y↑→x)
  size     : 2 × 5
  bandwidth: 1
  isReal   : false
```

## Integrals and component-wise reductions

With no axis argument, `sum` integrates every component over $$\mathrm{SO}(3)$$ and `mean`
returns its orientation-space mean. The result is a numeric array with the same component
shape.

```python
sum(SO3F1)
```

```text
array([78.9607 -0.j    , 38.7031+16.0773j])
```

---

```python
mean(SO3F4)
```

```text
array([[1.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j],
       [0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j]])
```

Passing an axis changes the meaning to an ordinary pointwise reduction over the function
array. The results below remain `SO3FunHarmonic` objects.

```python
sum(SO3F1, axis=0)
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (Quartz → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 48
  mean     : 1.49+0.2036j
  isReal   : false
```

---

```python
mean(SO3F4, axis=1)
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (1 → y↑→x)
  size     : 2
  bandwidth: 1
  isReal   : false
```

## Minima and maxima

With a single argument, `min` and `max` find a global extremum of every component
separately. They return numeric arrays, with the positions, and require real-valued
functions. Marking `SO3F4` as real enforces the coefficient symmetry required by this
search.

```python
SO3F4.isReal = True
min(SO3F4)[0]
```

```text
array([[ 1.    , -1.7321, -1.2247, -1.732 , -1.2247],
       [-1.7321, -1.2247, -1.732 , -1.2247, -1.7321]])
```

Passing an axis as `min(SO3F, axis=d)` instead computes a pointwise minimum along that
component axis. The result is again a vector-valued `SO3FunHarmonic`. Since `SO3F4` is
$$2\mathbin{\times}5$$, the following reduction leaves five functions.

```python
min(SO3F4, axis=0)
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (1 → y↑→x)
  size     : 5
  bandwidth: 1
```

## Pointwise products

The product `*` of two functions is evaluated pointwise in orientation space. It is not
the usual matrix product between the two function arrays. Both operands must have the same
symmetries, so the symmetry of `SO3F1` is set explicitly before multiplication, and its
two functions are arranged as a column so that they multiply the rows of `SO3F4`.

```python
SO3F1.CS = SO3F4.CS
SO3F1.reshape(2, 1) * SO3F4
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (1 → y↑→x)
  size     : 2 × 5
  bandwidth: 49
  isReal   : false
```

## Inspect all components

[plotSpektra](SO3Fun.plotSpektra.html) draws the harmonic power spectrum of every
component. The four curves show that components of one function array may have different
distributions over harmonic degree.

```python
plotSpektra(SO3F3, linewidth=2, figSize='small')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunVectorValued-21.png"></center>

An orientation-space section plot displays only the first component of a vector-valued
function, with a warning. Select and prepare a component explicitly when another component
or its imaginary part is required.

```python
with warnings.catch_warnings():
  warnings.simplefilter('ignore')
  plot(SO3F3)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunVectorValued-22.png"></center>

The three-dimensional plot has the same first-component restriction. The shape therefore
describes the real part of the first scalar function, not the magnitude of the
four-component array.

```python
with warnings.catch_warnings():
  warnings.simplefilter('ignore')
  plot3d(SO3F3)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunVectorValued-23.png"></center>

A fibre is a one-dimensional family of orientations. In contrast to the section and
three-dimensional plots, `plotFibre` draws every component along the selected beta fibre.
Here it draws the real parts, so the four curves can be compared at the same orientations.

```python
plotFibre(SO3F3, fibre.beta(), linewidth=2)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunVectorValued-24.png"></center>

components to specimen or crystal coordinates and account for how those vectors transform
with orientation.

## Technical Details

The port keeps a list of functions in NumPy's layout: the coefficients on the last axis of
`fhat`, where MATLAB has them on the first; a list of $$n$$ functions has the shape `(n,)`,
where MATLAB's is $$n\times 1$$, and multiplying it with a $$2\times5$$ array needs the
column `reshape(2, 1)`. An axis is counted from zero, MATLAB's `sum(SO3F1, 1)` being
`sum(SO3F1, axis=0)`; `min(f)` returns the values with their positions. A function built
from coefficients alone has the triclinic crystal frame on its right side where MATLAB's
has the specimen frame, so `SO3F1.CS` is set to that of `SO3F4`. Orientations take a
frame at construction, so the relabelled nodes are built anew from their rotations, and
the Dubna ODF is evaluated at the rotations of the triclinic nodes. The complex fourth
root of $$ab$$ is taken of complex numbers, as MATLAB's power of a negative number gives.
The function of the quadrature example is built from the quaternion components $$a, b, c$$
of a rotation, which depend on which of $$\pm q$$ represents it; the port and MATLAB choose
differently, so the four functions and their spectra differ from MATLAB's.
