<!--introduction-->

A grain boundary is stored as a list of short segments. Each segment lies between two
neighbouring measurements that belong to different grains. Selecting boundaries
therefore means indexing this list, and every selection returns another
`grainBoundary` list.

This page assumes that the map has already been divided into grains as in
[Grain Reconstruction](GrainReconstruction_py.html). The
[Grain Boundaries](GrainBoundaries.html) overview explains how these segments represent
an interface in a two-dimensional section.

```python
import numpy as np
from mtex import *
```

```python
# import the data
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('forsterite')

# restrict it to a subregion of interest
ebsd = ebsd[inpolygon(ebsd, np.array([5, 2, 10, 5]) * 1000)]

# reconstruct and smooth the grains
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, minPixel=5, alpha=10)
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 4)

# extract and plot the complete boundary list
gB = grains.boundary
plot(ebsd)
hold(True)
plot(gB, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundarySelect-2.png"></center>

The black network contains every boundary segment in the cropped map. It includes
boundaries between grains of one phase, boundaries between phases, and the outer rim of
the scan.

## What the list contains

Displaying `gB` reports the number and total length of the segments for every pair of
phases that meets in the map.

```python
gB
```

```text
grainBoundary (y↑→x)
  size: 2976 segments, 258 chains
  segments    length   mineral 1   mineral 2
       559  27508 µm  notIndexed  Forsterite
        32   1586 µm  notIndexed   Enstatite
        29   1392 µm  notIndexed    Diopside
      1196  55721 µm  Forsterite  Forsterite
       551  26039 µm  Forsterite   Enstatite
       437  20231 µm  Forsterite    Diopside
        27   1278 µm   Enstatite   Enstatite
       123   5705 µm   Enstatite    Diopside
        22    930 µm    Diopside    Diopside
```

The rows involving `notIndexed` combine two situations. Some segments border a connected
`notIndexed` area, whose diffraction patterns could not be indexed. Others lie on the
outer rim, where a grain is cut off by the scan and has no neighbour on the other side.
[Selecting Grains](SelectingGrains_py.html) shows how to identify grains at that rim.

## By the phases on either side

Two phase names select segments between those phases. The first selection contains
forsterite to forsterite boundaries, which separate differently oriented grains of the
dominant phase.

```python
gB_FoFo = gB['Fo', 'Fo']

plot(ebsd)
hold(True)
plot(gB_FoFo, lineColor='blue', micronbar='off', lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundarySelect-4.png"></center>

The thick blue segments occur within the forsterite part of the phase map. They do not
include its contacts with the other minerals.

The next selection contains forsterite to enstatite boundaries. A phase boundary is not
a separate object in MTEX. It is a grain boundary whose two neighbouring grains happen
to differ in phase.

```python
gB_FoEn = gB['Fo', 'En']

plot(ebsd)
hold(True)
plot(gB_FoEn, lineColor='darkgreen', micronbar='off', lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundarySelect-5.png"></center>

The green segments follow only contacts between the forsterite and enstatite regions.
They are two different crystals meeting, rather than two orientations of the same phase.

## Why phase order matters

The order of the phase names matters for more than readability. A misorientation is a
rotation *from* one crystal *to* another, so reversing the names gives inverse
misorientations. A misorientation axis expressed in crystal coordinates therefore refers
to whichever crystal was named first.

```python
mori = gB['Fo', 'En'].misorientation[0]
mori
```

```text
misorientation (Forsterite → Enstatite)
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1   Phi  phi2
  25.3  50.4   260
```

---

```python
inv(mori)
```

```text
misorientation (Enstatite → Forsterite)
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1   Phi  phi2
   280  50.4   155
```

The two phase orders select the same physical segments, but reversing the sides also
reverses the walk along every boundary chain. The segments are consequently not returned
in the same row order. Corresponding segments have exactly inverse misorientations, but
`gB['En', 'Fo'].misorientation[0]` is a different segment from the first one selected
above.

## By grain

A boundary list is also available from the grains it belongs to. This is how to ask for
the boundary of one grain or of a grain selection. Here `grains[72]` means the 73rd
grain in the current list, not necessarily a grain whose ID is 73;
[Selecting Grains](SelectingGrains_py.html) explains the distinction between list position
and grain ID.

```python
grains[72].boundary
```

```text
grainBoundary (y↑→x)
  size: 30 segments, 1 chains
  segments   length   mineral 1  mineral 2
        23  1077 µm  Forsterite   Diopside
         7   311 µm   Enstatite   Diopside
```

---

```python
plot(ebsd)
hold(True)
plot(grains[72].boundary, lineWidth=4, lineColor='DarkBlue')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundarySelect-9.png"></center>

The dark-blue outline includes every phase pair on the boundary of this grain. The
displayed boundary summary names the phases on its far side.

## Boundaries inside a grain

`grains.innerBoundary` stores segments between two measurements *of the same grain*.
They arise when the segmentation criterion separates two neighbouring pixels, but
another path through the map still connects them into one phase-homogeneous grain. An
orientation gradient that comes back around can produce exactly this situation.

```python
grains.innerBoundary
```

```text
grainBoundary (y↑→x)
  size: 1 segments, 1 chains
  segments  length   mineral 1   mineral 2
         1   19 µm  Forsterite  Forsterite
```

---

```python
plot(ebsd)
hold(True)
plot(grains.innerBoundary, lineColor='red', lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundarySelect-11.png"></center>

The display reports 11 inner-boundary segments in this barely deformed rock. The red
segments sit inside connected grains rather than tracing complete grain outlines.
Deformed material may contain many more, and
[Subgrain Boundaries](SubGrainBoundaries_py.html) explains how a two-threshold
reconstruction preserves a systematic low-angle population.

## By misorientation or another property

Every segment carries its misorientation. A logical condition on the misorientation
angle therefore selects segments in the same way as any NumPy logical index. Here the
eligible set is first restricted to forsterite to forsterite boundaries, so every angle
has one consistent pair of crystal symmetries.

```python
isHighAngle = gB_FoFo.misorientation.angle() > 60 * degree
gB_high = gB_FoFo[isHighAngle]
gB_high
```

```text
grainBoundary (y↑→x)
  size: 471 segments, 38 chains
  segments    length   mineral 1   mineral 2
       471  21928 µm  Forsterite  Forsterite
```

---

```python
plot(ebsd)
hold(True)
plot(gB_FoFo, lineColor='lightgray', lineWidth=2)
plot(gB_high, lineColor='red', lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundarySelect-13.png"></center>

The grey segments are all eligible forsterite boundaries, while red marks only those
above the chosen angle. The same pattern works with a condition on position, direction,
length, or any other per-segment property; see
[Grain Boundary Properties](BoundaryProperties_py.html).

More specialised misorientation selections compare an axis, a complete rotation, or a
coincidence site lattice relationship. They are developed in
[Twist and Tilt](TiltAndTwistBoundaries_py.html), [Twinning](TwinningBoundaries_py.html), and
[CSL](CSLBoundaries_py.html).

## Next

[Boundary Plots](BoundaryPlots_py.html) shows how to colour the selected segments by
scalar, directional, and full-misorientation data.
[Grain Boundary Properties](BoundaryProperties_py.html) then develops the per-segment
values from which more selections can be built.

## Technical Details

A pair of phase names in brackets selects segments, MATLAB's `gB('Fo','Fo')`, and a
boolean array selects them the same way. `calcGrains` returns the grains alone and
writes the grain of every measurement into the map it was given, so MATLAB's
`[grains, ebsd] = calcGrains(ebsd, ...)` is one assignment here; as there, a not indexed
measurement inside a grain takes its phase without an orientation. The grains are
numbered along x first where MATLAB numbers them along y first, so MATLAB's `grains(47)`,
the diopside grain with 23 forsterite and 7 enstatite segments, is `grains[72]` here.
