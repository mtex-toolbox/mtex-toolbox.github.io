<!--introduction-->

Quadrature replaces an integral over the sphere by a weighted sum at selected directions.
MTEX uses those sums to compute the spherical harmonic coefficients of a function that can
be evaluated at arbitrary directions. The result is an `S2FunHarmonic` that can be
evaluated, plotted, and combined with other spherical functions.

```python
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Construct a harmonic representation

Consider the scalar function $$f(\mathbf{v})=v_xv_y$$. A Python function expresses this
rule for one or many `vector3d` directions.

```python
fun = lambda v: v.x * v.y
```

[S2FunHarmonic.quadrature](S2FunHarmonic.quadrature.html) evaluates the function on a
quadrature grid and applies the corresponding weights. The `bandwidth` is the largest
harmonic degree retained in the result. Because this example is a quadratic polynomial,
degree 2 is sufficient.

```python
sF = S2FunHarmonic.quadrature(fun, bandwidth=2)
sF
```

```text
S2FunHarmonic
  bandwidth: 2
  mean     : 3.424e-17
```

The surface radius and colour both show the function value.

```python
surf(sF)
mtexColorbar()
```

Notice the four alternating lobes around the equator. The function is zero whenever
either $$v_x$$ or $$v_y$$ is zero, and it changes sign across each of those two great
circles.

## Check the recovered function

Quadrature constructs coefficients rather than merely storing the sampled values. We can
therefore evaluate the result at directions that were not chosen as quadrature nodes. The
maximum error below tests a regular grid with a spacing of $$5$$ degrees.

```python
vTest = regularS2Grid(resolution=5 * degree).flatten()
maxError = np.max(np.abs(sF.eval(vTest) - fun(vTest)))
maxError
```

```text
7.7716e-16
```

The error is at numerical round-off because the requested bandwidth contains every
harmonic degree in this polynomial. For a general function, increase the bandwidth until
the features or derived quantities of interest no longer change appreciably.

## What bandwidth leaves out

Bandwidth 1 cannot represent the degree-2 variation of this example. The corresponding
result is nearly zero, so its error remains large even though the quadrature itself has
been carried out correctly.

```python
sFLow = S2FunHarmonic.quadrature(fun, bandwidth=1)
lowBandwidthError = np.max(np.abs(sFLow.eval(vTest) - fun(vTest)))
lowBandwidthError
```

```text
0.5000
```

This is truncation error, not evidence that more scattered data are needed. Quadrature
assumes a callable function over the whole sphere. If only scattered directions and
values are available, use interpolation or approximation instead.

## Supplying a quadrature grid explicitly

The high-level call creates its own nodes and weights. The same operation can start from
an explicit `quadratureS2Grid` when the function values have already been evaluated
there.

```python
S2G = quadratureS2Grid(2)
values = fun(S2G)
sFGrid = S2FunHarmonic.quadrature(S2G, values)
gridResultDifference = np.max(np.abs(sFGrid.eval(vTest) - sF.eval(vTest)))
gridResultDifference
```

```text
0
```

The grid carries its own weights, and the difference is at numerical round-off.
Arbitrary scattered directions are not automatically a quadrature rule: their weights
must represent area on the sphere. Without suitable weights, dense regions would
contribute too much to the coefficients.

## The maths behind quadrature

Let $$Y_n^k$$ be an orthonormal spherical harmonic. Its coefficient in a function $$f$$ is

$$ \hat f_n^k = \int_{S^2} f(\mathbf{v})\,
\overline{Y_n^k(\mathbf{v})}\,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}. $$

A quadrature grid supplies nodes $$\mathbf{v}_m$$ and area weights $$w_m$$. MTEX
approximates every coefficient through degree $$N$$ by

$$ \hat f_n^k \approx \sum_m w_m f(\mathbf{v}_m)
\overline{Y_n^k(\mathbf{v}_m)}, \qquad 0\leq n\leq N. $$

The `bandwidth` option sets $$N$$. It controls both the finest variation retained in the
harmonic representation and the quadrature grid required to compute its coefficients.

Continue with [Harmonic Representation](S2FunHarmonicRepresentation_py.html) to inspect
and truncate the coefficients produced by quadrature. If your starting point is scattered
measurements, see [Approximation and Interpolation](S2FunApproximationInterpolation_py.html).

## Technical Details

At bandwidth 1 the port's quadrature is the exact projection, which is zero for $$v_xv_y$$,
so the error is $$\max|v_xv_y| = 0.5$$; MATLAB's grid for bandwidth 1 is too coarse for the
degree-2 function, which aliases into the low degrees and gives 0.6667. A
`quadratureS2Grid` is a list of directions, as in MATLAB, and brings its bandwidth to
`S2FunHarmonic.quadrature`.
