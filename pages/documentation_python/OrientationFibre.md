<!--introduction-->

A *fibre* is a one-dimensional curve through orientation space. Every orientation on a
full fibre maps one fixed crystal direction `h` onto one fixed specimen direction `r`
while leaving rotation about that direction free. MTEX stores the curve as a
[fibre](fibre.fibre.html) variable.

Many real textures concentrate around a line rather than one ideal orientation. Rolling
textures of cubic metals are therefore commonly described by named fibres. A real
texture has a finite spread around the curve; the curve itself is the ideal centreline.

This page assumes [orientation construction](OrientationDefinition_py.html),
[symmetry-equivalent orientations](OrientationSymmetry_py.html), and
[the fundamental region](OrientationFundamentalRegion_py.html). The Cube and Goss components
below are introduced in [Standard Orientations](OrientationStandard_py.html).

A *reference frame* is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. The plotting
convention below lays specimen Y upward and specimen X to the right. It changes only the
screen layout, not the orientations.

```python
from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')

# define crystal and specimen symmetry
cs = crystalFrame('432')
ss = specimenFrame('1')

# define two ideal orientations
ori1 = orientation.cube(cs, ss)
ori2 = orientation.goss(cs, ss)

# select the representative of Goss nearest to Cube
ori2 = ori2.projectIntoFundamentalRegion(ori1)
```

## A Fibre Segment Between Two Orientations

The endpoint constructor joins two orientation representatives by their shortest angular
path. The result is a finite segment, not yet the full closed fibre.

```python
segmentFibre = fibre(ori1, ori2)
segmentFibre
```

```text
fibre (432 → y↑→x)
  h || r : [100] || (1,0,0)
  o1 → o2: (0°,0°,0°) → (0°,45°,0°)
```

The summary identifies the aligned directions in its `h` and `r` row. Its endpoint row
runs from Cube at $$(0^\circ,0^\circ,0^\circ)$$ to Goss at $$(0^\circ,45^\circ,0^\circ)$$ in
Bunge Euler angles. Both endpoints, and every orientation `ori` between them, satisfy

$$ \mathtt{ori} * h = r. $$

The two directions belong to different reference frames: `h` is in the crystal frame and
`r` is in the specimen frame.

## The Segment in Euler Space

The default three-dimensional orientation plot uses Bunge Euler coordinates.

```python
plot(segmentFibre, displayName='Fibre segment', lineWidth=4, lineColor='green')
hold(True)
plot(ori1, displayName='Cube', markerSize=12, markerFaceColor='darkred', markerEdgeColor='k')
plot(ori2, displayName='Goss', markerSize=12, markerFaceColor='blue', markerEdgeColor='k')
hold(False)
legend(location='northwest')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-3.png"></center>

The green line runs from the dark-red Cube marker to the blue Goss marker. It looks
straight because only $$\Phi$$ changes for this pair. In general, a shortest angular path
need not look straight in Euler coordinates.

## The Same Segment in Axis--Angle Space

```python
plot(segmentFibre, 'axisAngle', lineColor='green', lineWidth=6)
hold(True)
plot(ori1, 'axisAngle', markerFaceColor='darkred', markerSize=15)
plot(ori2, 'axisAngle', markerFaceColor='blue', markerSize=15)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-4.png"></center>

This is the same orientation-space segment in different coordinates. The endpoints and
angular distances have not changed. Only the coordinate map used to draw them has
changed.

## Extending the Segment to a Full Fibre

The option `full` discards the finite endpoint and continues through every rotation
about the aligned direction.

```python
fullFibre = fibre(ori1, ori2, full=True)
fullFibre
```

```text
fibre (432 → y↑→x)
  h || r: [100] || (1,0,0)
```

The `h` and `r` row is unchanged, while the endpoint row has disappeared. Orientation
space itself has no boundary, so the full fibre closes into a circle. Coordinate domains
and symmetry-reduced fundamental regions do have seams and boundaries, however, and can
cut that circle into arcs.

```python
hold(True)
plot(fullFibre, 'axisAngle', lineColor='gold', lineWidth=3, fundamentalRegion=True)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-6.png"></center>

The gold curve continues the green segment to the faces of the cubic fundamental region.
Its boundary points reconnect through symmetry-equivalent faces, so this
boundary-to-boundary line represents one closed fibre.

## Fibres in Pole Figures

Everything that can be plotted for orientations can also be plotted for fibres.
[plotPF](fibre.plotPDF.html) maps the fibre into [pole figures](OrientationPoleFigure_py.html),
where one orientation becomes a point and a fibre becomes a curve.

```python
h = Miller([[1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]], cs)
plotPF(fullFibre, h, lineWidth=3, lineColor='orange')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-7.png"></center>

Each panel contains one trace from the representative fibre. A trace may meet a
projection boundary, but it still represents one continuous set of orientations.

## Symmetrising a Fibre

Unlike an orientation pole-figure plot, a fibre is not automatically symmetrised.
[symmetrise](fibre.symmetrise.html) generates the crystallographically equivalent
fibres. The `unique` option removes repeated copies.

```python
symFibre = fullFibre.symmetrise(unique=True)
symmetryCopyCount = len(symFibre)
symmetryCopyCount
```

```text
6
```

The six copies correspond to the six cubic equivalents of the aligned crystal direction.
Plotting them adds the orange traces that were absent from the representative-only pole
figures.

```python
plotPF(symFibre, Miller([[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]], cs), lineWidth=3, lineColor='orange')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-9.png"></center>

## Fibres in Inverse Pole Figures

[plotIPF](fibre.plotIPDF.html) maps the fibre into
[inverse pole figures](OrientationInversePoleFigure_py.html). It fixes specimen directions
and draws the crystal directions found along the fibre. By default it restricts them to
the fundamental sector.

```python
r = vector3d([[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]])
plotIPF(symFibre, r, lineWidth=3, lineColor='orange')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-10.png"></center>

Each panel folds the symmetry copies into one fundamental sector. The orange curve is
therefore the family of crystal directions that can lie along the specimen direction
named above that panel.

## The Complete Inverse Pole Figure

The option `complete` removes the fundamental-sector restriction.

```python
plotIPF(symFibre, vector3d.Z, complete=True, lineWidth=3, lineColor='orange')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-11.png"></center>

The complete plot repeats the curve across the full crystal-direction sphere. Those
repeated traces are symmetry equivalents, not additional input fibres.

## Defining a Fibre by Directions

A Miller direction and a [vector3d](vector3d.vector3d.html) specimen
direction define the full fibre directly. The next fibre contains every orientation that
makes the crystal c-axis $$[001]$$ parallel to specimen Z.

```python
cAxisFibre = fibre(Miller(0, 0, 1, cs, 'uvw'), vector3d.Z)
cAxisFibre
```

```text
fibre (432 → y↑→x)
  h || r: [001] || (0,0,1)
```

The summary states that [001] is parallel to (0,0,1). The directions are shown in crystal
and specimen coordinates, respectively.

```python
plot(cAxisFibre, 'axisAngle', lineColor='gold', lineWidth=4, fundamentalRegion=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-13.png"></center>

The gold line is the symmetry-reduced image of every possible rotation about the aligned
c-axis. Its two boundary ends continue into one another, so it represents one full fibre
rather than one finite segment.

If both constructor directions are `Miller` variables, the fibre instead contains all
misorientations that bring one crystal direction into alignment with the other.

## A Fibre Through One Orientation

An initial orientation `ori1` and a crystal direction `h` define all orientations that
preserve the mapped direction of `ori1`:

$$ \mathtt{ori} * h = \mathtt{ori1} * h. $$

The following full fibre passes through Cube and rotates about its $$[111]$$ axis.

```python
cube111Fibre = fibre(ori1, Miller(1, 1, 1, cs, 'uvw'))
cube111Fibre
```

```text
fibre (432 → y↑→x)
  h || r: [111] || (1,1,1)
```

Its summary reports that [111] is parallel to (1,1,1). Cube maps this crystal direction
onto the same specimen direction.

```python
plot(cube111Fibre, 'axisAngle', lineColor='darkred', lineWidth=4, fundamentalRegion=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-15.png"></center>

The dark-red curve passes through the Cube orientation at zero angle. Its ends meet the
boundary at symmetry-equivalent continuations of the curve.

[orientation](fibre.orientation.html) samples a fibre for numerical work.
[angle](fibre.angle.html) measures the angular distance from an orientation to its
nearest point on a fibre. Their geometric use without crystal symmetry is developed in
[Fibres in Rotation Space](RotationFibre_py.html).

## Predefined Rolling Fibres

Cubic rolling textures have named segments, as their ideal components do: alpha, beta,
gamma, epsilon, eta, tau, and theta. MTEX provides each as a static `fibre` constructor.
These names assume the conventional rolling frame and orthorhombic specimen symmetry.

```python
ss = specimenFrame('orthorhombic')
beta = fibre.beta(cs, ss)
```

Plot the conventional endpoint segment returned by each constructor. Passing
`full=True` would extend that segment around its entire direction-pair circle.

```python
plot(fibre.alpha(cs, ss), lineWidth=3, lineColor=ind2color(1), displayName='alpha')
hold(True)
plot(fibre.beta(cs, ss), lineWidth=3, lineColor=ind2color(2), displayName='beta')
plot(fibre.gamma(cs, ss), lineWidth=3, lineColor=ind2color(3), displayName='gamma')
plot(fibre.epsilon(cs, ss), lineWidth=3, lineColor=ind2color(4), displayName='epsilon')
plot(fibre.eta(cs, ss), lineWidth=3, lineColor=ind2color(5), displayName='eta')
plot(fibre.tau(cs, ss), lineWidth=3, lineColor=ind2color(6), displayName='tau')
plot(fibre.theta(cs, ss), lineWidth=3, lineColor=ind2color(7), displayName='theta')
hold(False)
legend(location='best')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-17.png"></center>

The coloured curves occupy different routes through Euler space and meet at some shared
ideal components. Each colour marks only the conventional named segment, not every point
on its full direction-pair circle.

## Fibre ODFs

A fibre is a curve of zero orientation-space volume, while a real texture has a spread
around one. [fibreODF](fibreODF.html) turns the full curve into a density with a given
halfwidth. This is the model fitted against a measurement.

```python
betaFull = fibre.beta(cs, ss, full=True)
odf = fibreODF(betaFull, halfwidth=10 * degree)
```

The result is an `SO3FunCBF` with a de la Vallée Poussin kernel. Its $$10^\circ$$
halfwidth is the distance where the density has fallen to half its peak, not a cutoff
radius. The density is constant along the ideal fibre and decays away from it.

```python
plot3d(odf)
hold(True)
plot(betaFull.symmetrise(), lineColor='blue', lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-19.png"></center>

The blue curves are the ideal centrelines. The surrounding surface is the finite-width
density, so it forms a tube rather than a line.

## Evaluating an ODF Along a Fibre

[plotFibre](SO3Fun.plotFibre.html) evaluates an ODF along a chosen curve. Here the
beta-fibre ODF is read along the eta fibre.

```python
plotFibre(odf, fibre.eta(cs, ss), lineWidth=2, figSize='small')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationFibre-20.png"></center>

The vertical axis is density in multiples of a random distribution. The broad maximum
marks the part of the eta segment closest to the beta-fibre ridge.

## The Volume Around a Fibre

[volume](SO3Fun.volume.html) integrates the ODF inside a tube of a given angular radius
about a fibre. This is the quantity meant when a texture is reported as "so many percent
beta fibre".

```python
volume5Percent = 100 * volume(odf, betaFull, 5 * degree)
volume5Percent
```

```text
7.2535
```

The result is about 58 percent within $$5^\circ$$ of the fibre it was built on. At the
$$10^\circ$$ kernel halfwidth, the numerical tube integral reaches unity.

```python
volume10Percent = 100 * volume(odf, betaFull, 10 * degree)
volume10Percent
```

```text
25.9752
```

The second result is 100 percent to the precision printed. It does not mean the ODF is a
zero-width line or vanishes at $$10^\circ$$. [fibreVolume](SO3Fun.fibreVolume.html)
discretises the tube and clips its numerical estimate at 1, so the displayed percentage
can be exactly 100.

## The Maths Behind Pole Figures

Let $$f(g)$$ be an ODF, $$h$$ a crystal direction, and $$r$$ a specimen direction. The pole
density at $$r$$ is

$$ P_h(r) = \int_{\{g:\,g h=r\}} f(g)\,\mathrm{d}g. $$

The integration set is exactly the full orientation fibre defined by `g * h = r`. This
crystallographic Radon transform connects the geometry on this page to measured pole
figures and ODF reconstruction; see the [pole figure tutorial](PoleFigureTutorial_py.html).
