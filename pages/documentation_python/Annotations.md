<!--introduction-->

A colour-coded pole figure needs a colour scale before its values can be
read. Markers, labels, legends, and grids then make particular features
identifiable. Together these annotations turn a finished plot into a figure
that another reader can interpret and compare.
Without marked directions, only a reader who already knows the figure's
contents can identify them.

This page starts with numerical colour scales. It then marks known
directions and orientations, identifies plotted objects, and adds an angular
grid. Each operation modifies an existing figure.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Colour scales for numerical data

[mtexColorbar](mtexColorbar.html) differs from matplotlib's `colorbar` in
that it addresses the whole MTEX figure. Every axis in a multi-plot gets a
colourbar. The example uses two model components so that the plotted pole
densities have recognisable maxima.

```python
# define a two-component model ODF
cs = crystalFrame('-3m')

mod1 = orientation.byEuler(110 * degree, 30 * degree, 80 * degree, cs)
mod2 = orientation.byEuler(310 * degree, 70 * degree, 40 * degree, cs)
odf = 0.7 * unimodalODF(mod1) + 0.3 * unimodalODF(mod2)

# plot two pole figures
plotPDF(odf, Miller([[1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]], cs))

# add a colourbar to each pole figure
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Annotations-2.png"></center>

Notice that the two colourbars have different ranges. Equal colours do not
yet represent equal pole densities in the two panels. Calling
`mtexColorbar` again removes the colourbars. The `location` option places
the replacements below the panels, while `title` names their unit. Pole
density is measured in multiples of a random distribution, abbreviated mrd.

```python
# remove the vertical colourbars
mtexColorbar()

# add horizontal colourbars
mtexColorbar(location='southoutside', title='mrd')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Annotations-3.png"></center>

For a direct comparison, first give every axis the same colour range. One
colourbar can then describe the entire figure. The same colour now means the
same pole density in both panels. See [Colour Coding](ColorMaps_py.html) for
choosing the colours themselves.

```python
mtexColorbar()               # remove the colourbars
setColorRange('equal')       # use one colour range for all panels
mtexColorbar()               # create one colourbar for the figure
```

## Marking directions and orientations

[annotate](annotate.html) adds to an existing figure without disturbing
it. It needs no `hold(True)` and does not change the colour range. First mark
a specimen direction on both pole figures above. A specimen direction is a
direction expressed in the specimen frame. The text passed through `label`
is arbitrary; here it names the vector drawn at $$(1,1,1)$$.

```python
annotate(vector3d(1, 1, 1), label=['(111)'], BackgroundColor='w')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Annotations-5.png"></center>

In an inverse pole figure, a crystal direction is the natural annotation.
It is a direction expressed in the crystal frame. The `all` option draws
every symmetrically equivalent direction. The `labeled` option writes the
Miller indices beside those markers.

```python
plotIPDF(odf, [xvector, zvector], antipodal=True, marginx=10)
mtexColorMap('white2black')

annotate(Miller([[2, -1, -1, 0], [2, -1, -1, 1]], cs), all=True, labeled=True, BackgroundColor='yellow')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Annotations-6.png"></center>

The axes of an inverse pole figure are the fundamental sector of the
crystal symmetry, so most symmetrically equivalent copies of a direction
fall outside them. Each supplied index is labelled where it lands inside
the sector.

A whole orientation can also be marked. MTEX draws it wherever that
orientation appears. It places one marker per pole in every axis. The next
figure marks the two components used to construct the model ODF.

```python
plotIPDF(odf, [xvector, zvector], antipodal=True)
mtexColorMap('white2black')
annotate(mod1, marker='s', MarkerSize=6, MarkerFaceColor='r', label='A', color='w')

annotate(mod2, marker='s', MarkerSize=6, MarkerFaceColor='g', label='B')

gcm().drawNow(figSize='normal')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Annotations-7.png"></center>

The red squares sit on the maxima, while the green ones mark the weaker
component. These known orientations provide a direct check on the plot.

The same annotation works on ODF sections. In a section, an orientation is
represented by one point rather than by one pole in every axis.

```python
plotSection(odf, 'sigma')
mtexColorMap('white2black')
annotate(mod1, label='A', textColor='r', MarkerSize=15, MarkerEdgeColor='r', MarkerFaceColor='none')

annotate(mod2, label='B', textColor='b', MarkerSize=15, MarkerEdgeColor='b', MarkerFaceColor='none')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Annotations-8.png"></center>

The outlined labels identify the two component positions without covering
the density underneath. The same annotation also works on a scatter plot of
individual orientations. It shows which model components the sampled point
cloud lies around.

```python
ori = odf.discreteSample(200)
scatter(ori)
annotate(mod1, MarkerSize=10, MarkerEdgeColor='r', MarkerFaceColor='r')
annotate(mod2, MarkerSize=10, MarkerEdgeColor='g', MarkerFaceColor='g')
```

## Legends

A colourbar explains numerical values encoded by colour. A legend instead
identifies plotted objects by a label and symbol. Anything plotted with a
`DisplayName` enters the legend, while everything else stays out. In a
multi-plot figure, combine `DisplayName` with `add2all`. The object and
its legend entry then appear on every panel.

```python
plotPDF(odf, Miller([[1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]], cs))
plot(ori, MarkerFaceColor='k', MarkerEdgeColor='black', add2all=True, DisplayName='randomSample')

f = fibre(Miller(1, 1, -2, 1, cs), vector3d.Y)
plot(f, color='red', linewidth=2, add2all=True, DisplayName='fibre')

legend('show')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Annotations-10.png"></center>

The black points and red curve now have the same names in both pole figures.
See [Legends](Legends_py.html) for legend placement and formatting.

A line plot also needs a legend when several curves share one axis. Here the
harmonic coefficients of the two-component ODF are compared with those of a
fibre ODF through their power at each harmonic degree.

```python
plt.close('all')
plotSpektra(FourierODF(odf, 32), DisplayName='Two-component ODF', figSize='small')
hold(True)
fodf = fibreODF(Miller(1, 0, 0, cs), zvector)
plotSpektra(FourierODF(fodf, 32), DisplayName='Fibre ODF')
hold(False)
legend('show')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Annotations-11.png"></center>

The fibre ODF decays faster, as a function with a rotational symmetry
must. It has fewer degrees of freedom to spend at each harmonic degree. The
legend makes it possible to assign that decay to the correct curve.

## A spherical grid

A grid of latitude and longitude lines makes the projection legible and
lets angles be read from the figure. The `grid` flag switches it on, and
`grid_res` sets the angular spacing.

```python
plotPDF(odf, [Miller(1, 0, 0, cs), Miller(0, 0, 1, cs)], grid=True, grid_res=15 * degree, antipodal=True)
mtexColorMap('white2black')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Annotations-12.png"></center>

At 15 degrees the lines are close enough for approximate measurements and
far enough apart not to compete with the pole-density pattern. The grid is
part of the spherical projection; it does not change the sampled data.

## Next

Once the figure carries the information needed to read it, continue with
[Exporting Figures](PlottingExport_py.html). It explains how figure size,
renderer, and file format affect the exported result.

## Technical Details

The 200 orientations of `discreteSample` are random draws, so the point clouds differ from
MATLAB's in their details. The MATLAB reference run of the spectrum cell stopped in the
`wignerTrafoAdjoint` MEX file (a static TLS allocation of `libgomp`), so that figure is
compared with the MATLAB script alone.
