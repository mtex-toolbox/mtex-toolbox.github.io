<!--introduction-->

Suppose that a quantity has been measured at orientations $$\mathtt{ori}_m$$, with one value
$$v_m$$ at each orientation. The task is to replace those samples by a function that can be
evaluated and plotted at any orientation. MTEX calls this operation `interp`, although the
fitted function need not pass through every sample exactly.

The values may be an orientation distribution function (ODF), such as volume fractions
measured at different orientations. They may instead be any scalar physical property that
depends on orientation. This distinction determines whether the fitted function must be
nonnegative and have mean 1.

```python
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Importing the samples

An ASCII file can contain one orientation and one or more measured values per row.
[loadOrientation](orientation.load.html) needs the columns of the Euler angles and the
names of the additional columns.

```python
fname = mtexdatafile('dubnaValues')
ori, S = loadOrientation(fname, columnNames=['phi1', 'Phi', 'phi2', 'values'])
```

The result `ori` contains the sample orientations. The table `S` has one column for every
additional column of the file, so the values in this file are available as `S['values']`.

```python
plotSection(ori, S['values'], 'sigma', all=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunApproximationTheory-3.png"></center>

Each marker in the section plot is one sample, and its colour is the corresponding value.
Notice the isolated high-value regions and the large areas with values close to zero. A
useful approximation should retain those regions without introducing unsupported
oscillations.

## Choosing an approximation

Approximation finds a function that agrees reasonably well with the data. Interpolation is
the special case in which it agrees exactly at the sample orientations. Noise, incomplete
sampling, or regularization often makes approximation the more useful goal.

[interp](rotation.interp.html) provides three approximation schemes:

* A harmonic expansion is a global series model. Prefer it for a general
  orientation-dependent relationship, especially with many nodes, outliers, or noise.
* A radial-basis-function (RBF) model is a weighted sum of kernels centred on a grid.
  Prefer it for an ODF with a low or medium number of nodes, and use `'density'` when
  nonnegativity and mean 1 are required.
* A Bingham distribution is a compact parametric density model. Use it only when one
  Bingham-shaped component is physically appropriate.

These are starting points rather than rules. In practice, compare the computational cost
and the fitted shapes from both harmonic and RBF models. The residual at the samples is
useful, but it cannot by itself reveal oscillations or overfitting between them.

## Harmonic approximation

The flag `'harmonic'` selects a harmonic expansion. Internally, `interp` calls
[SO3FunHarmonic.interpolate](SO3FunHarmonic.interpolate.html). The default fit includes
regularization, which suppresses rapidly varying harmonic coefficients.

```python
SO3FReg = interp(ori, S['values'], 'harmonic')
SO3FReg
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (1 → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 18
  mean     : 0.9974
```

---

```python
relativeErrorReg = norm(SO3FReg.eval(ori) - S['values']) / norm(S['values'])
relativeErrorReg
```

```text
0.0463
```

---

```python
plot(SO3FReg, 'sigma')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunApproximationTheory-6.png"></center>

Compare this plot with the discrete samples. The strongest regions remain in the same
sections, while regularization rounds their peaks and prevents the fit from following
every local variation.

The default regularization parameter is $$\lambda=10^{-8}$$. Setting it to zero switches
regularization off and asks the harmonic model to follow the samples more closely.

```python
SO3FUnreg = interp(ori, S['values'], 'harmonic', regularization=0)
SO3FUnreg
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (1 → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 18
  mean     : 0.9973
```

---

```python
relativeErrorUnreg = norm(SO3FUnreg.eval(ori) - S['values']) / norm(S['values'])
relativeErrorUnreg
```

```text
0.0463
```

---

```python
plot(SO3FUnreg, 'sigma')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunApproximationTheory-9.png"></center>

A converged unregularized solution is free to make the residual much smaller, but it can
create narrow peaks and ripples between the samples. Do not interpret an unconverged
residual as the optimum. Even after convergence, a smaller residual is not by itself
evidence for a better model. The [next page](HarmonicApproximationTheory_py.html) explains
how to choose regularization and check solver convergence.

Reducing the harmonic bandwidth is another form of regularization. The bandwidth is the
largest harmonic degree retained by the series.

```python
SO3FLow = interp(ori, S['values'], 'harmonic', regularization=0, bandwidth=16)
SO3FLow
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (1 → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 16
  mean     : 0.9981
```

---

```python
relativeErrorLow = norm(SO3FLow.eval(ori) - S['values']) / norm(S['values'])
relativeErrorLow
```

```text
0.1057
```

---

```python
plot(SO3FLow, 'sigma')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunApproximationTheory-12.png"></center>

The bandwidth-16 fit cannot reproduce variations finer than its truncated series permits.
It is smoother than the unrestricted unregularized fit, but bandwidth alone does not
enforce the physical constraints of an ODF. In particular, harmonic approximation cannot
guarantee a nonnegative function even when every supplied value is nonnegative.

```python
minimumHarmonicValue = min(SO3FLow)[0]
minimumHarmonicValue
```

```text
-12.2598
```

## Density-constrained RBF approximation

Without a method flag, `interp` uses an RBF model and internally calls
[SO3FunRBF.interpolate](SO3FunRBF.interpolate.html). The `'density'` flag constrains the
weights so that the result is nonnegative and then normalizes its mean to 1.

```python
SO3FDensity = interp(ori, S['values'], 'density')
relativeErrorDensity = norm(SO3FDensity.eval(ori) - S['values']) / norm(S['values'])
relativeErrorDensity
```

```text
0.0130
```

---

```python
minimumDensityValue = min(SO3FDensity)[0]
minimumDensityValue
```

```text
3.6446e-04
```

---

```python
meanDensityValue = mean(SO3FDensity)
meanDensityValue
```

```text
1
```

---

```python
plot(SO3FDensity, 'sigma')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunApproximationTheory-17.png"></center>

The peaks follow the high-valued sample regions, while the background remains
nonnegative. The printed minimum and mean check the two density constraints directly. The
residual can be larger than for an unconstrained fit because those constraints remove
otherwise admissible solutions. If the iteration limit was reached, the coefficients may
not yet be optimal. Adjust `maxit` or `tol` before making a quantitative comparison.

The key smoothing parameter is the kernel halfwidth. A larger halfwidth blends information
over a wider angular neighbourhood. A very small halfwidth can overfit the samples.

```python
psi = SO3DeLaValleePoussinKernel(halfwidth=2.5 * degree)
SO3FNarrow = interp(ori, S['values'], 'density', kernel=psi, resolution=5 * degree)
plot(SO3FNarrow, 'sigma')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunApproximationTheory-18.png"></center>

The centre spacing remains 5 degrees, so the change from the default fit comes from the
2.5 degree kernels. They produce narrower local features. Features that merely mirror the
sample spacing are a warning that the halfwidth is too small. The
[RBF theory page](RBFApproximationTheory_py.html) develops this diagnostic and the other
solver options.

## Unconstrained RBF approximation

Omitting `'density'` solves an unconstrained least-squares problem. As in the harmonic
setting, the result may become negative and its mean need not equal 1.

```python
SO3FRBF = interp(ori, S['values'])
relativeErrorRBF = norm(SO3FRBF.eval(ori) - S['values']) / norm(S['values'])
relativeErrorRBF
```

```text
7.2691e-04
```

---

```python
minimumRBFValue = min(SO3FRBF)[0]
minimumRBFValue
```

```text
-6.0187
```

---

```python
meanRBFValue = mean(SO3FRBF)
meanRBFValue
```

```text
0.9800
```

---

```python
plot(SO3FRBF, 'sigma')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunApproximationTheory-22.png"></center>

The unconstrained plot may follow the samples more closely, but the printed minimum and
mean show why it should not automatically be interpreted as an ODF. Use this form for a
general scalar response whose sign and mean are not prescribed. The same iteration-limit
warning applies here: validate convergence before comparing residuals.

## Fitting a Bingham distribution

[SO3FunBingham.interpolate](SO3FunBingham.interpolate.html) fits the samples with one
Bingham distribution. The flag `'bingham'` selects it through `interp`. The following
controlled example begins with a fibre ODF and samples it on a coarse grid.

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
cs = crystalFrame("1")
odf = fibreODF(fibre.rand(cs, rng=rng))
S3G = equispacedSO3Grid(cs, resolution=15 * degree)
v = odf.eval(S3G)

plot(odf)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunApproximationTheory-23.png"></center>

The source ODF has a continuous ridge of high values along one fibre. A Bingham
distribution with two large equal concentrations and one zero is exactly that girdle
shape, so a single component describes this ODF almost perfectly.

```python
SO3FBingham = interp(S3G, v, 'bingham')
SO3FBingham
```

```text
SO3FunBingham (1 → y↑→x)
  kappa : [92.064 92.063  0.517  0.   ]
  weight: 1
```

---

```python
relativeErrorBingham = norm(SO3FBingham.eval(S3G) - v) / norm(v)
relativeErrorBingham
```

```text
0.0045
```

---

```python
plot(SO3FBingham)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunApproximationTheory-26.png"></center>

The printed concentrations show the girdle case, the residual is about one percent, and
the two plots are hard to tell apart. One Bingham component has few parameters, so a
source whose structure a girdle cannot hold - several separated components, say - is
where this fit would fall short.

Bingham approximation currently works only for trivial symmetry. Do not use this route for
the nontrivial symmetries: with a crystal symmetry the sample is first moved about its mean
into one fundamental region, and the tensor of a density spread over that region is not
the one of a Bingham distribution.

## A response that is not an ODF

Density constraints are wrong for a property that may be negative or need not have mean 1.
To make that distinction visible, consider noisy samples of

$$ f(\mathbf{R}) = \cos(\omega(\mathbf{R})) \sin(3\varphi_1(\mathbf{R})) + \frac{1}{2}. $$

Here $$\omega(\mathbf{R})$$ is the rotation angle, and $$\varphi_1(\mathbf{R})$$ is the first
Euler angle of $$\mathbf{R}$$.

```python
f = SO3FunHandle(lambda r: np.cos(r.angle()) * np.sin(3 * r.phi1) + 0.5)
plot(f, 'sigma')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunApproximationTheory-27.png"></center>

The exact response contains broad positive and negative lobes. A density fit would erase
the negative part and change the intended quantity.

```python
ori2 = orientation.rand(100000, rng=rng)
val2 = f.eval(ori2)
val2 = val2 + rng.standard_normal(val2.shape) * 0.05 * np.std(val2, ddof=1)
```

Fit the same 100,000 noisy samples with an unconstrained harmonic model and an
unconstrained RBF model. A 12 degree RBF centre grid keeps this teaching example practical
while retaining the large set of observations.

```python
FH = interp(ori2, val2, 'harmonic')
FH
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (1 → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 40
  mean     : 0.4999
```

---

```python
plot(FH, 'sigma')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunApproximationTheory-30.png"></center>

The harmonic fit recovers the broad alternating lobes, and it follows the samples more
closely than the noise level warrants: its values run well outside the exact range of
$$-0.5$$ to $$1.5$$, so the global series is fitting the noise along with the signal.

```python
FK = interp(ori2, val2, resolution=12 * degree)
FK
```

The RBF fit recovers the same sign changes through overlapping local kernels and stays
much closer to the exact range. It reproduces the noisy samples less well and the
underlying function better. Choose between the two by validation error on held-out
samples and by computational cost, not by how closely each reproduces the data it was
given.
