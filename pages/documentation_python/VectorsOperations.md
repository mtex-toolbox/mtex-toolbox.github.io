<!--introduction-->

Three-dimensional vectors can be added, scaled, compared, and combined. Every operation
works on a whole list at once, so a loop over vectors is usually unnecessary in MTEX.

This page assumes the construction methods from
[Defining Three Dimensional Vectors](VectorDefinition_py.html). A reference frame is the
coordinate system in which the vectors are expressed. The plotting convention below only
lays that frame out on screen; it does not change the vectors.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Building New Vectors

Sums and multiples of the specimen axes `vector3d.X`, `vector3d.Y`, and `vector3d.Z` are
`vector3d` objects again.

```python
v = vector3d.X + 2 * vector3d.Y
v
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  x  y  z
  1  2  0
```

[+](vector3d.plus.html) and [-](vector3d.minus.html) add or subtract Cartesian
components. [*](vector3d.mtimes.html) scales a vector by a scalar. The inner product
[dot](vector3d.dot.html) and cross product [cross](vector3d.cross.html) have their usual
linear-algebra meanings. The order of the cross product matters.

```python
u = dot(v, vector3d.Y) * vector3d.Y + 2 * cross(v, vector3d.Z)
u
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  x  y  z
  4  0  0
```

The first term is $$2\vec Y$$, while the second is $$4\vec X-2\vec Y$$. Their Y components
cancel, leaving $$\vec u=4\vec X$$. The arrows show the original vector in the XY plane and
the result along positive X.

```python
newMtexFigure()
arrow3d(v, label='v')
hold(True)
arrow3d(u, label='u')
hold(False)
```

## Angles

The [angle](vector3d.angle.html) between two directions is a central measurement in
texture analysis. One example is the tilt of a lattice-plane normal away from the sheet
normal. The angle between complete crystal orientations is a different operation,
introduced in [Misorientations](MisorientationTheory_py.html).

```python
angle(vector3d.X, vector3d.Y) / degree
```

```text
90
```

MTEX returns angles in radians, hence the division by `degree`. The angle between
directed vectors lies between $$0$$ and $$180^\circ$$. If the data represent axes instead,
the answer is never obtuse; see [Axes and Antipodal Symmetry](VectorsAxes_py.html).

## Length and Normalization

[norm](vector3d.norm.html) returns the length of each vector.
[normalize](vector3d.normalize.html) divides each vector by its length.

```python
norm(u)
```

```text
4
```

---

```python
u = normalize(u)
u
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  x  y  z
  1  0  0
```

Normalization does not change where a vector points, so it does not move its position
in a spherical plot. It matters in calculations: the `dot` of two unit vectors is the
cosine of their angle.

```python
dot(normalize(v), vector3d.Y)
```

```text
0.8944
```

A zero vector has no direction. Consequently, `normalize(vector3d(0,0,0))` has undefined,
NaN components.

## Lists of Vectors

`cat` joins vectors into one list, and an index selects an entry, the first one being
`w[0]`. The general rules are covered in [Lists and Indexing](ListsAndIndexing_py.html).

```python
w = cat(v, u)
w[0]
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  x  y  z
  1  2  0
```

Arithmetic on a list is entry by entry. Adding the single vector `v` to the two-entry
list `w` adds it to both entries.

```python
w = w + v
w
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  size: 2
  x  y  z
  2  4  0
  2  2  0
```

When both inputs are lists of the same size, binary operations pair their entries by
position. The keyword `outer=True` of [angle](vector3d.angle_outer.html) and
[dot](vector3d.dot_outer.html) compares every entry of one list with every entry of
another.

## Selecting from a List

The following file contains directions stored as polar and azimuth angles. Its displayed
summary confirms that the resulting `vector3d` list has 1,000 entries.

```python
fname = mtexdatafile('vectors')
v = vector3d.load(fname, columnNames=['polar angle', 'azimuth angle'])
v
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  size: 1000
        x       y       z
    0.174   0.984  0.0454
  0.00906   0.822   0.569
     0.43   0.901  0.0587
   -0.447  0.0187   0.894
    -0.14   0.556    0.82
        ⋮       ⋮       ⋮
    0.418   0.738    0.53
    0.205   0.196   0.959
   -0.323   0.268   0.908
   -0.249  -0.274   0.929
    0.146   0.982   0.116
```

A logical condition retains only directions with a polar angle below $$60^\circ$$.

```python
selected = v.theta < 60 * degree
scatter(v[selected], grid=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/VectorsOperations-14.png"></center>

The empty outer ring shows that every plotted direction lies within $$60^\circ$$ of the Z
axis. Count the omitted entries directly.

```python
numOmitted = np.sum(~selected)
numOmitted
```

```text
236
```

Thus, 236 of the 1,000 directions lie at least $$60^\circ$$ away from the Z axis.

## Averaging a List

[mean](vector3d.mean.html) averages the Cartesian components. The result is a mean
vector, which generally is not a unit vector.

```python
m = mean(v)
m
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
       x      y      z
  -0.137  0.198  0.677
```

Normalizing it gives the mean direction.

```python
meanDirection = normalize(m)
meanDirection
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
      x      y      z
  -0.19  0.276  0.942
```

Because every input vector has unit length, the length of `m` is the mean resultant
length.

```python
meanResultantLength = norm(m)
meanResultantLength
```

```text
0.7186
```

Here it is about 0.719. Identical unit directions give one; dispersed or mutually
cancelling directions give a shorter result. Normalize unequal input vectors first when
this directional statistic is intended.

Opposite directed observations cancel. For axes, where `v` and `-v` mean the same thing,
use `mean(v, antipodal=True)` instead; see
[Axes and Antipodal Symmetry](VectorsAxes_py.html).

## Next

[Density Estimation](VectorsDensityEstimation_py.html) replaces a long list of directions
by a smooth function on the sphere. Read [Axes and Antipodal Symmetry](VectorsAxes_py.html)
before analysing data whose two signs are physically equivalent. Turning a direction into
another one is the job of a [rotation](Rotations.html).
