<!--introduction-->

This page reconstructs prior austenite grains from a martensite EBSD map. It continues the
workflow introduced in [Parent Beta Phase Reconstruction](TiBetaReconstruction_py.html). Here
the orientation relationship (OR) must first be fitted to the steel.

The worked sequence has four stages: fit the OR, choose parent variants, merge compatible
grains, and transfer the result back to the pixel map.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('martensite', silent=True)
```

## Segment the measured martensite

A grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels produced by
segmentation. A 3-degree threshold separates the child grains. Grains with fewer than two
pixels are removed during segmentation.

```python
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=3 * degree, minPixel=2, alpha=12)

plot(ebsd['Iron bcc'], ebsd['Iron bcc'].orientations, figSize='large')
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-2.png"></center>

The orientation colours form groups inside larger, former austenite regions. The black lines
show the deliberately fine child-grain partition. Reconstruction must decide which
neighbouring child grains share a parent.

## Set up the reconstruction job

A [`parentGrainReconstructor`](parentGrainReconstructor.parentGrainReconstructor.html)
stores the input and the current reconstruction. It also records how each measured child
grain maps to a recovered parent.

```python
job = parentGrainReconstructor(ebsd, grains)
```

The constructor guesses the parent and child phases from their populations. Supply an OR as
the third constructor argument if that guess is wrong. In this fully transformed sample, we
instead set the phase symmetries by assigning an initial parent-to-child OR after
construction.

```python
job.p2c = orientation.KurdjumovSachs(job.csParent, job.csChild)
job
```

```text

  phase   mineral         symmetry  grains  area  reconstructed
  parent  Iron fcc        432       0       0%    0%

 OR: (111) || (011)   [101̅] || [111̅]
   c2c fit: 2.5°, 3.5°, 4.4°, 5.3° (quintiles)
```

The displayed summary reports parent and child grain counts, their areas, and the fraction
of input child grains already transformed. It also reports four quintiles of the boundary OR
misfit. For the initial Kurdjumov-Sachs (KS) guess these are 2.51, 3.49, 4.41, and 5.35
degrees, as printed below.

## Fit the parent-to-child orientation relationship

A real austenite-to-martensite transformation does not follow one ideal OR exactly. The OR
should therefore be fitted for each sample.
[`calcParent2Child`](parentGrainReconstructor.calcParent2Child.html) implements the
iterative method proposed by Nyyssönen and co-workers. It starts from the KS guess and fits
the child-to-child misorientations.

```python
initialFit = job.calcGBFit()[0] / degree
fitQuantilesInitial = np.nanquantile(initialFit, [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8])
print(fitQuantilesInitial)

# a line plot must not reuse the map figure - its axes leaves no room for labels
plt.close('all')
plt.hist(initialFit, bins=int(np.sqrt(len(initialFit))), histtype='stepfilled', alpha=0.6, label='initial KS OR')

job.calcParent2Child()

optimizedFit = job.calcGBFit()[0] / degree
fitQuantilesOptimized = np.nanquantile(optimizedFit, [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8])
print(fitQuantilesOptimized)
plt.hist(optimizedFit, bins=int(np.sqrt(len(optimizedFit))), histtype='stepfilled', alpha=0.6, label='fitted OR')
plt.xlabel('disorientation angle (degrees)')
plt.legend()
job
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-5.png"></center>

The fitted OR is 2.5 degrees from the ideal Nishiyama-Wassermann OR. Its first misfit
quintile is 1.3 degrees, rather than 2.5 degrees. The fitted histogram is therefore shifted
towards smaller disorientations.

The earlier version of this page said that `calcParent2Child` stored these values in
`job.fit`. The current class has no such property. Use
[`calcGBFit`](parentGrainReconstructor.calcGBFit.html) to recompute them. The fit assumes
that most measured boundaries are child-to-child boundaries.

## Map the boundary misfit

`calcGBFit` returns one fit for every child-grain neighbour pair.
[`selectByGrainId`](grainBoundary.selectByGrainId.html) selects all boundary segments
belonging to those pairs.

```python
fit, c2cPairs = job.calcGBFit()
gB, pairId = job.grains.boundary.selectByGrainId(c2cPairs)

plot(ebsd['Iron bcc'], ebsd['Iron bcc'].orientations, figSize='large', faceAlpha=0.5)
hold(True)
plot(gB, edgeAlpha=np.clip((fit[pairId] / degree - 2.5) / 2, 0, 1), lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-6.png"></center>

Transparency converts the angular fit to a boundary diagnostic. Opaque segments have larger
misfit, while faint segments better match the fitted OR. Spatial clusters of opaque segments
deserve scrutiny before the reconstruction parameters are relaxed.

## Build the variant graph

A *variant* is one crystallographically equivalent child orientation predicted from a
single parent orientation through the known OR. A *variant graph* has one node per
child-grain and candidate-variant pair. Edges connect compatible candidates belonging to
neighbouring grains.

[`calcVariantGraph`](parentGrainReconstructor.calcVariantGraph.html) converts angular misfit
into an edge weight. The `threshold` is the misfit whose weight is one half. The `tolerance`
controls the width of the transition from high to low weight. Earlier text called
`tolerance` a Gaussian standard deviation, but the implementation uses it directly as the
transition-width parameter.

```python
job.calcVariantGraph(threshold=3.5 * degree, tolerance=3.5 * degree)
job
```

```text

   closest ideal OR: (111) || (011)   [11̅0] || [100] fit: 2.3°

 variant graph: 561554 entries
```

Earlier versions also passed `'tortuosity'` here. `calcVariantGraph` has no such option, so
MATLAB silently ignored it. The graph above uses only the documented threshold and tolerance
options.

Large maps can reduce the first graph by grouping similarly oriented variants, then separate
them in a second pass:

```python
job.calcVariantGraph(threshold=2.5 * degree, tolerance=2.5 * degree, mergeSimilar=True)
job.clusterVariantGraph()
job.calcVariantGraph(threshold=2.5 * degree, tolerance=2.5 * degree)
```

This two-pass route trades variant resolution in the first graph for lower cost. The present
map is small enough to retain every variant immediately.

## Cluster candidate variants

[`clusterVariantGraph`](parentGrainReconstructor.clusterVariantGraph.html) propagates
compatibility through the graph. The `includeSimilar` option lets candidates within 5
degrees share support.

```python
job.clusterVariantGraph(includeSimilar=True)
job
```

 votes: 10654 × 1
   probabilities: 100%, 99%, 98%, 96% (quintiles)
```

The result is the table `job.votes`. Row `i` of `job.votes.prob` ranks the candidate
probabilities for grain `i`. The matching entries in `job.votes.parentId` identify those
candidates. The first column is the best-supported candidate.

```python
plot(job.grains, job.votes.prob[:, 0])
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-9.png"></center>

Large uniform values mark grains with a clear parent assignment. Values near 0.5 indicate at
least two similarly plausible parents. Such ambiguity often occurs when the candidates are
related by twinning.

## Transform the confident child grains

*Transform* is the first parent grain reconstruction step. Each selected child grain
receives one candidate parent orientation and changes from the child phase to the parent
phase. Here only best candidates with probability above 0.5 are accepted.

```python
job.calcParentFromVote(minProb=0.5)
print(job)

plot(job.parentGrains, job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)
```

```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-10.png"></center>

The map contains transformed parent fragments rather than final parent grain footprints. The
strict vote transforms 10,581 child grains, leaving 64 child grains that occupy 0.59% of the
indexed area. A manual alternative is
[`selectInteractive`](parentGrainReconstructor.selectInteractive.html):

```python
job.selectInteractive()
```

It lets a reader click a grain and choose among its candidate parents. It is not executed
here because a published page must run without clicks.

## Reconsider uncertain grains from their neighbours

A second variant-graph pass with relaxed probabilities is one route. Here
[`calcGBVotes`](parentGrainReconstructor.calcGBVotes.html) instead asks the already
reconstructed neighbours to vote for potential parents. `reconsiderAll` also permits an
earlier assignment to be replaced.

```python
job.calcGBVotes(p2c=True, reconsiderAll=True, threshold=4 * degree, tolerance=1.5 * degree)
print(job)

job.calcParentFromVote()
print(job)

plot(job.parentGrains, job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-11.png"></center>

Earlier versions passed `'tortuosity'` to `calcGBVotes` as well. That function also has no
such option, so it had no effect. The new parent fragments fill much of the space left by
the strict vote. It leaves 48 child grains, occupying 0.088% of the indexed area.

## Merge compatible parent fragments

*Merge* is the second parent grain reconstruction step. Neighbouring transformed grains with
compatible parent orientations are combined into one parent-grain footprint.
[`mergeSimilar`](parentGrainReconstructor.mergeSimilar.html) uses a 7.5-degree threshold
here.

```python
job.mergeSimilar(threshold=7.5 * degree)
job.grains = smoothBoundary(job.grains, 20)

plot(job.parentGrains, job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-12.png"></center>

The similarly coloured fragments have coalesced into larger parent grains. Small enclosed
child grains still interrupt some of those footprints.

## Merge small inclusions

An inclusion is a grain entirely enclosed by another grain. Some poorly indexed child grains
remain as inclusions because no parent orientation could be assigned confidently.
[`mergeInclusions`](parentGrainReconstructor.mergeInclusions.html) merges inclusions of at
most 50 pixels into the surrounding parent grain.

```python
job.mergeInclusions(maxSize=50)

plot(job.parentGrains, job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-13.png"></center>

The large parent-grain shapes remain, while small enclosed fragments no longer break them
up. This operation changes topology rather than choosing another parent variant.

## Identify variants and packets

Once the parent orientations are known, [`calcVariants`](parentGrainReconstructor.calcVariants.html)
classifies each transformed child grain. `variantId` is its finest crystallographic class. A
*packet* groups variants that share the parent {111} habit plane. In this reconstruction,
`packetId` selects the parent {111} plane closest to the martensite (011) plane.

```python
job.calcVariants()

color = ind2color(job.transformedGrains.packetId)
plot(job.transformedGrains, color, faceAlpha=0.5)

hold(True)
parentGrains = smoothBoundary(job.parentGrains, 10)
plot(parentGrains.boundary, lineWidth=3)

grainSelected = parentGrains[parentGrains.findByLocation([100, 80])]
plot(grainSelected.boundary, lineWidth=3, lineColor='w')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-14.png"></center>

Equal colours identify child grains in the same packet. Thick black lines show reconstructed
parent boundaries. The white outline selects one parent grain for a closer crystallographic
check.

## Trace the selected parent back to its children

`job.grainsPrior` preserves the grains before reconstruction. For every input grain,
`job.mergeId` stores the ID of its current parent. Combining them selects all children of
the outlined parent grain.

```python
childGrains = job.grainsPrior[job.mergeId == grainSelected.id]

selectedParentId = grainSelected.id
print(selectedParentId)

plot(childGrains, childGrains.meanOrientation)
hold(True)
plot(grainSelected.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

```text
[121]
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-15.png"></center>

The original page described this grain as parent 279. The printed `selectedParentId` checks
that concrete ID against the current segmentation. It is 288 in the current run, showing why
IDs should not be assumed to remain fixed across releases. The child-grain mosaic exactly
fills the selected parent outline.

## Check the selected parent's crystallography

[`calcVariantId`](calcVariantId.html) independently assigns variant and packet IDs to every
measured child orientation inside the selected parent.

```python
childOri = job.ebsdPrior[childGrains].orientations
parentOri = grainSelected.meanOrientation
variantId, packetId, _, _ = calcVariantId(parentOri, childOri, job.p2c)

color = ind2color(packetId)
plotPDF(childOri, color, Miller(0, 0, 1, childOri.CS), MarkerSize=2, all=True)

hold(True)
plot(parentOri.symmetrise() * Miller(0, 0, 1, parentOri.CS), markerSize=10, marker='s', markerFaceColor='w', markerEdgeColor='k',
     lineWidth=2)

childVariants = variants(job.p2c, parentOri)
plotPDF(childVariants, markerFaceColor='none', lineWidth=1.5, markerEdgeColor='k')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-16.png"></center>

Coloured points are measured child orientations, grouped by packet. Black open markers are
the theoretical variants of the reconstructed parent. Their agreement tests the
reconstruction inside one grain rather than only checking the final boundary shapes.

## Reconstruct the parent EBSD map

The reconstruction so far used grain means.
[`calcParentEBSD`](parentGrainReconstructor.calcParentEBSD.html) assigns a parent
orientation to each transformed pixel in the original EBSD map.

```python
parentEBSD = job.calcParentEBSD()

plot(parentEBSD['Iron fcc'], parentEBSD['Iron fcc'].orientations, figSize='large')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-17.png"></center>

The reconstructed pixel colours follow the parent-grain partition. Remaining blank pixels
were not assigned a parent orientation.

## Check the per-pixel reconstruction fit

`parentEBSD.fit` is the angular mismatch between the parent orientation reconstructed from
one pixel and the orientation assigned to its grain.

```python
plot(parentEBSD, parentEBSD.fit / degree, figSize='large')
mtexColorbar()
setColorRange([0, 5])
mtexColorMap('LaboTeX')

hold(True)
plot(job.grains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-18.png"></center>

Low values show pixels consistent with the reconstructed parent grain. The black boundaries
reveal whether larger fits concentrate at parent-grain edges or occupy a grain interior.

## Fill the parent map

Some pixels remain notIndexed or not reconstructed. We first segment the reconstructed
parent map and smooth its boundaries.

```python
parentGrains = calcGrains(parentEBSD, angle=3 * degree, minPixel=10)
parentGrains = smoothBoundary(parentGrains, 20)

plot(ebsd, ebsd.orientations, figSize='large')
hold(True)
plot(parentGrains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-19.png"></center>

The outlines define the parent regions that constrain the fill operation.
[`smooth`](EBSD.smooth.html) then fills holes without crossing those outlines.

```python
F = halfQuadraticFilter()
parentEBSD = smooth(parentEBSD, F, fill=parentGrains)

plot(parentEBSD['Iron fcc'], parentEBSD['Iron fcc'].orientations, figSize='large')
hold(True)
plot(parentGrains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/MaParentGrainReconstruction-20.png"></center>

The filled map is continuous inside each reconstructed parent grain. The boundaries still
preserve the grain partition used during filtering.
