<!--introduction-->

A spatial change in lattice orientation requires dislocations to preserve
compatibility. These are *geometrically necessary dislocations* (GNDs).
Conventional two-dimensional EBSD measures only the in-plane orientation
gradient, so it cannot identify a unique three-dimensional dislocation
population.

The workflow on this page follows Pantleon (2008). It computes the measured
lattice curvature and fits the least-energy combination of candidate
dislocation systems that reproduces it. Read
[Dislocation Systems](DislocationSystems_py.html) first for the Burgers vector,
line vector, tensor basis, and relative line-energy weights used here.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

## Load and segment the map

The example is a ferritic steel map after two percent uniaxial deformation.
The `minPixel` option marks indexed regions smaller than six pixels as
`notIndexed` during segmentation. A 2.5 degree threshold separates the
remaining grains.

```python
plottingConvention.default('y←↑x')
ebsd = mtexdata('dc06')

grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=2.5 * degree, minPixel=6)
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 5)
```

An inverse pole figure (IPF) key colors each indexed orientation by the
crystal direction parallel to specimen $$y$$. The boundaries provide the
spatial context for the orientation changes used below.

```python
ipfKey = ipfHSVKey(ebsd)
ipfKey.ipfDirection = yvector

plot(ebsd, ipfKey.orientation2color(ebsd.orientations), refFrame='on', figSize='medium')
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, linewidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/GND-4.png"></center>

Notice that each grain has a dominant color, while smaller color changes
remain inside many grains. Those intragranular changes carry the curvature
signal, together with measurement noise.

## Denoise before differentiating

Differentiation amplifies point-to-point orientation noise and therefore
overestimates GND density. An axis-angle color key makes local departures
from each grain's mean orientation easier to see before filtering.

```python
axisKey = axisAngleColorKey(ebsd)
axisKey.oriRef = grains['id', ebsd['indexed'].grainId].meanOrientation

plot(ebsd['indexed'], axisKey.orientation2color(ebsd['indexed'].orientations), micronBar='off', figSize='medium')
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, linewidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/GND-5.png"></center>

The pixel-scale color speckle is the symptom to notice. A
`halfQuadraticFilter` reduces that noise while the `fill` option uses the
grain partition to prevent smoothing across grain boundaries.

```python
F = halfQuadraticFilter()
ebsd = smooth(ebsd, F, fill=grains)

axisKey.oriRef = grains['id', ebsd['indexed'].grainId].meanOrientation
plot(ebsd['indexed'], axisKey.orientation2color(ebsd['indexed'].orientations), micronBar='off', figSize='medium')
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, linewidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/GND-6.png"></center>

The denoised map retains broad color gradients inside grains but suppresses
much of the isolated pixel-to-pixel variation. Filtering is therefore part
of the measurement model, not merely cosmetic preparation for the plot.

## Estimate GND content in one command

Ferrite is body-centred cubic, so this example uses the standard BCC set of
48 edge and 4 screw systems. Following the normalization on the preceding
page, the edge weight is one and the screw weight is $$1-\nu$$, with
Poisson's ratio $$\nu=0.3$$.

There is no universally accepted set of line-energy weights. Replace these
illustrative values with values appropriate to the material and model.

```python
dS = dislocationSystem.bcc(ebsd.CS)
nu = 0.3
dS.u[dS.isEdge] = 1
dS.u[dS.isScrew] = 1 - nu
```

[`calcGND`](EBSD.calcGND.html) returns an energy-weighted GND density for
each pixel and the signed density assigned to each candidate system.
The first output is often called the total dislocation energy. With the
dimensionless weights above, it is an energy-weighted density rather than
an absolute energy measurement.

```python
gnd, rho = calcGND(ebsd, dS)

plot(ebsd, gnd, micronbar='off')
mtexColorMap('hot')
mtexColorbar()
setColorScale('log')
setColorRange([1e11, 5e14])
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, linewidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/GND-8.png"></center>

Read the map on its logarithmic scale. Bright regions require a larger
energy-weighted dislocation content to reproduce the measured curvature;
dark regions require less. Grain boundaries are overlaid for location, but
the fitted values belong to EBSD pixels rather than boundary segments.

## The maths behind the workflow

The remainder of the page expands the operations performed by `calcGND`.
This sequence is useful when you need to inspect tensor components, change
the candidate systems, or retain their individual fitted densities.

## Compute the incomplete curvature tensor

The curvature tensor $$\boldsymbol\kappa$$ collects directional derivatives
of lattice orientation. A two-dimensional map supplies derivatives along
its two in-plane directions but not along the map normal.

```python
kappaMeasured = ebsd.curvature()
kappaMeasured
```

```text
curvatureTensor (y←↑x)
  unit: 1/um
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  size: 101 × 51
```

Inspect one pixel and one component. Indexing with brackets selects map
positions, counted from zero; the component $$(1,2)$$ over the whole map is the
slice of the coefficient array `M`, MATLAB's curly braces.

```python
kappaMeasured[2, 1]
```

```text
curvatureTensor (y←↑x)
  unit: 1/um
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  *10^-4
  -0.7842  -5.0601  NaN
  -0.5695  -5.8882  NaN
   2.0359  -1.9214  NaN
```

```python
kappa12 = kappaMeasured.M[..., 0, 1]
kappa12.shape
```

```text
(101, 51)
```

The component array has the same size as the EBSD map. For this scan the
unknown out-of-plane derivative occupies the third tensor column, so that
column contains `NaN`.

```python
newMtexFigure(layout=[3, 3], figSize='large')
for i in range(3):
  for j in range(3):
    nextAxis(i + 1, j + 1)
    plot(ebsd, kappaMeasured.M[..., i, j], micronBar='off')
    hold(True)
    plot(grains.boundary, linewidth=2)
    hold(False)
setColorRange([-0.005, 0.005])
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/GND-12.png"></center>

Read columns from left to right in each tensor row. The blank panels in the
third column make the unmeasured out-of-plane derivative explicit; they are
not zero-curvature components.

## Convert curvature to the Nye tensor

Nye's dislocation-density tensor $$\boldsymbol\alpha$$ is related to
curvature by

$$ \boldsymbol\alpha = \boldsymbol\kappa^{T}
   - \mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol\kappa)\,\mathbf I. $$

The method [`dislocationDensity`](curvatureTensor.dislocationDensity.html)
applies this relation.

```python
alphaMeasured = kappaMeasured.dislocationDensity()
alphaMeasured
```

```text
dislocationDensityTensor (y←↑x)
  unit: 1/um
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  size: 101 × 51
```

```python
alphaMeasured[2, 1]
```

```text
dislocationDensityTensor (y←↑x)
  unit: 1/um
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  *10^-4
      NaN  -0.5695   2.0359
  -5.0601      NaN  -1.9214
      NaN      NaN   6.6724
```

This tensor remains incomplete because the map contains no derivative
normal to its plane. MTEX can recover the $$(3,3)$$ entry from the two known
diagonal curvature components, but the other missing entries remain `NaN`.

## Rotate the candidate systems

Each tensor supplied by `dS.tensor` is the rank-two dyad
$$\mathbf b\otimes\hat{\mathbf l}$$. Its length unit is inherited from the
unit cell, usually Angstrom and displayed as `au`.

The tensors are initially expressed in the crystal frame. The measured
curvature is expressed in the specimen frame, so each pixel orientation
must rotate all candidate systems into that same frame; MATLAB's outer
product `ebsd.orientations * dS` is a column of orientations times a row of
systems.

```python
dSRot = ebsd.orientations.reshape(-1, 1) * dS

dS[0].tensor()
```

```text
dislocationDensityTensor (Iron (Alpha))
  unit: au
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  -1.1717  -0.5858   0.5858
   1.1717   0.5858  -0.5858
  -1.1717  -0.5858   0.5858
```

## Fit individual system densities

[`fitDislocationSystems`](curvatureTensor.fitDislocationSystems.html)
solves a linear program at every pixel. It reproduces the six measured
curvature components while minimizing
$$\sum_j u_j\lvert\rho_j\rvert$$ over the candidate systems.

The port solves the programs with its own simplex, all pixels in parallel,
where MATLAB needs the Optimization Toolbox function `linprog`. The result
`rho` has one row per EBSD pixel and one column per dislocation system. Its
signs distinguish the two line senses represented internally during the fit.

```python
rhoWorked, factor = fitDislocationSystems(kappaMeasured, dSRot)
rhoWorked.shape
```

```text
(5151, 52)
```

```python
factor
```

```text
1.0000e+16
```

The scale factor converts the density coefficients from
$$1/(\mathrm{\mu m}\,\mathrm{au})$$ to $$1/\mathrm{m}^2$$. With micrometre scan
units and Angstrom lattice units it is $$10^{16}$$.

## Reconstruct the fitted tensors

Sum each rotated basis tensor multiplied by its fitted density. The numeric
matrix `rhoWorked` does not retain units, so the tensor unit must be restored
explicitly after this manual reconstruction.

```python
alphaFitted = (dSRot.tensor() * rhoWorked).sum(axis=1).reshape(ebsd.shape)
alphaFitted.unit = '1/um'

alphaFitted[2, 1]
```

```text
dislocationDensityTensor (y←↑x)
  unit: 1/um
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  *10^-4
   3.7475  -0.5695   2.0359
  -5.0601  -1.3565  -1.9214
  -0.4706  -1.8151   6.6724
```

```python
kappaMeasured[2, 1].dislocationDensity()
```

```text
dislocationDensityTensor (y←↑x)
  unit: 1/um
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  *10^-4
      NaN  -0.5695   2.0359
  -5.0601      NaN  -1.9214
      NaN      NaN   6.6724
```

The fitted tensor is complete because the chosen dislocation population
supplies the components that EBSD cannot measure directly. Converting it
back gives a complete fitted curvature tensor.

```python
kappaFitted = alphaFitted.curvature()
kappaFitted
```

```text
curvatureTensor (y←↑x)
  unit: 1/um
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  size: 101 × 51
```

```python
kappaFitted[2, 1]
```

```text
curvatureTensor (y←↑x)
  unit: 1/um
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  *10^-4
  -0.7842  -5.0601  -0.4706
  -0.5695  -5.8882  -1.8151
   2.0359  -1.9214   2.1407
```

```python
newMtexFigure(layout=[3, 3], figSize='large')
for i in range(3):
  for j in range(3):
    nextAxis(i + 1, j + 1)
    plot(ebsd, kappaFitted.M[..., i, j], micronBar='off')
    hold(True)
    plot(grains.boundary, linewidth=2)
    hold(False)
setColorRange([-0.005, 0.005])
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/GND-22.png"></center>

Unlike the measured grid, this grid has values in all nine panels. The
fitted in-plane columns reproduce the observations; the third column is a
model-dependent completion, not an additional EBSD measurement.

## Reproduce the one-command result

Multiplying the absolute fitted densities by their line-energy weights and
by the unit factor gives the scalar returned by `calcGND`.

```python
gndWorked = factor * np.sum(np.abs(rhoWorked * dSRot.u), axis=1)
np.nanmax(np.abs(gndWorked - gnd.reshape(-1)))
```

```text
0
```

The zero difference verifies that the expanded sequence and `calcGND` use
the same calculation. Plotting the worked result therefore reproduces the
first GND map.

```python
plot(ebsd, gndWorked.reshape(ebsd.shape), micronbar='off')
mtexColorMap('hot')
mtexColorbar()
setColorScale('log')
setColorRange([1e11, 5e14])
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, linewidth=2)
hold(False)
```
