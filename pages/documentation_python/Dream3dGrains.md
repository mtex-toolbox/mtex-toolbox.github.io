<!--introduction-->

A DREAM.3D file can store a three-dimensional microstructure as a surface mesh. The mesh
contains vertices, triangular faces, and grain labels.

The two-dimensional chapters define a grain as a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected
region of EBSD pixels produced by segmentation. Here, DREAM.3D supplies the
three-dimensional counterparts as closed surface meshes. See
[3D-Grains](Grains3D_py.html) for an introduction to this representation.

The importer expects the DREAM.3D triangle-mesh datasets described by `loadGrains3d`.
The voxel data of a DREAM.3D file is read by `EBSD3.load` instead and segmented into
grains by `calcGrains`.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')

fname = mtexdatafile('SmallIN100')
grains = grain3d.load(fname)
print(grains)
```

```text
grain3d (y↑→x)
  Phase  Grains              Mineral  Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      794 (volume 15625)  unknown  LightSkyBlue  432       unknown
  boundary faces: 757564
```

## Read the imported object

The printed summary confirms what the import produced. It lists the phases and the
number and total volume of their grains, and it reports the number of boundary faces.
The sample contains 794 grains with total volume 15,625 and 757,564 faces. Their
symmetry is 432, and the imported mineral name is `unknown`.

Grain ids remain attached to grains when you subset a collection. Array indices are
positions in the current collection. Select by id when identity matters; the two only
happen to coincide in an unfiltered list.

```python
grainId = 2
grain = grains['id', grainId]
```

## Orient the face normals outwards

A face normal is perpendicular to one triangular boundary face. Its sign depends on the
order in which the face vertices are stored, known as the face winding.

By default, `grain3d.load` calls `orientFaces`. This gives every shared face one
consistent direction. It points from the first entry of `boundary.grainId` to the
second, so it cannot point outwards from both adjacent grains.

The row of `grain.I_GF` records which direction is outward for this grain. Multiplying
by its signs turns the shared face normals into outward normals. We plot a regular
subset so that the individual arrows remain visible.

```python
faceIndex = np.arange(0, len(grain.boundary), 20)
face = grain.boundary[faceIndex]
faceCentroid = face.centroid
outwardNormal = grain.I_GF[:, faceIndex].toarray().reshape(-1) * face.N

plot(grain, faceAlpha=0.65, edgeAlpha=0.25)
hold(True)
quiver3(faceCentroid, outwardNormal, arrowSize=0.15, color=[0.7, 0, 0])
hold(False)
setCamera(plottingConvention.default3D)
```

Each arrow starts at a face centroid and points away from the grain. The pale edges
reveal the triangular surface mesh. The arrows sample its faces; they are not one arrow
per neighbouring grain.

A reference frame is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. These normals
share the spatial reference frame of the mesh vertices. They describe boundary-plane
directions, not the misorientation across a face.

Pass `noOrientFaces=True` to `grain3d.load` only when the raw stored winding is
required. With raw winding, normal directions and signed volumes are not meaningful. The
`boundary.grainId` order has no geometric direction either.

## Where to continue

[Properties of Three-Dimensional Grains](Grains3DProperties_py.html) explains face areas,
centroids, normals, surface area, and volume. Continue with
[Boundary Normal Distribution](BoundaryNormalDistribution_py.html) to analyse the measured
boundary-plane directions statistically.

## Technical details

MATLAB builds the file name from `mtexDataPath`; here `mtexdatafile('SmallIN100')` gives
it, fetching the file from the MTEX data repository on first use. The selection by id is
`grains['id', grainId]`, MATLAB's `grains('id', grainId)`.
