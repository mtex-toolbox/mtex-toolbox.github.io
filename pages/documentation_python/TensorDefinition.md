<!--introduction-->

A material property is anisotropic when its response depends on direction.
A tensor stores that directional dependence and relates physical quantities.
For example, elastic stiffness relates strain to stress.

The *rank* of a tensor is the number of indices needed to name one
component. In three dimensions, a rank $$r$$ tensor has $$3^r$$ components
before physical and crystal symmetries are applied.
Rank is therefore not the size of a matrix.

MTEX represents every rank with [tensor](tensor.tensor.html).
Physically specific subclasses add units, conventions, and operations.
Read [Vectors](VectorDefinition_py.html) first if vector components are new.
[Crystal Reference System](CrystalReferenceSystem_py.html) explains how a
crystal lattice is attached to Cartesian axes.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Scalars: rank zero

A scalar has no directional index.
Temperature and density are examples.
The displayed object confirms that MTEX stores one coefficient at rank zero.

```python
M = 5
T0 = tensor(M, rank=0)
T0
```

```text
tensor (y↑→x)
  rank: 0
  5
```

## Vectors: rank one

A vector has one component for each axis of its reference frame.
The column below contains the components along x, y, and z.

```python
T1 = tensor([1, 2, 3], rank=1)
T1
```

```text
tensor (y↑→x)
  rank: 1 (3)
  1
  2
  3
```

Rank one tensors and [vector3d](vector3d.vector3d.html) objects can be converted into
each other. The output below is a `vector3d` rather than a `tensor`.

```python
T1x = tensor(xvector)
v = vector3d(T1x)
v
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  x  y  z
  1  0  0
```

## Matrices: rank two

A rank two tensor has two indices and is represented by a $$3\times3$$
component matrix. For the stress tensor, one index selects a traction
component and the other identifies the normal to the plane on which it acts.

$$
\sigma_{ij} =
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma_{11} & \sigma_{12} & \sigma_{13} \\
\sigma_{21} & \sigma_{22} & \sigma_{23} \\
\sigma_{31} & \sigma_{32} & \sigma_{33}
\end{array}\right].
$$

A diagonal rank two tensor has no coupling between different axes.

```python
T2diagonal = tensor(np.diag([1, 2, 3]), rank=2)
```

Off-diagonal entries describe coupling between different axes.
The display reports both the rank and all nine components.

```python
M = [[1,    0.75, 0.5],
     [0.75, 1,    0.25],
     [0.5,  0.25, 1]]

T2 = tensor(M, rank=2)
T2
```

```text
tensor (y↑→x)
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
     1  0.75   0.5
  0.75     1  0.25
   0.5  0.25     1
```

## Piezoelectricity: rank three

The direct piezoelectric effect relates a rank two stress to a rank one
electric displacement through a rank three tensor $$d$$:

$$ D_i = d_{ijk}\,\sigma_{jk}. $$

A general rank three tensor has $$3^3=27$$ components.
Since stress is symmetric, $$d_{ijk}=d_{ikj}$$ and the last two indices can
be stored as six columns rather than a $$3\times3\times3$$ array.

The following coefficients are a compact right-handed $$\alpha$$-quartz example.
`doubleConvention=True` says that columns 4 to 6 contain twice the corresponding
off-diagonal tensor components.

```python
M = [[-1.9222, 1.9222, 0, -0.1423, 0,      0],
     [0,       0,      0, 0,       0.1423, 3.8444],
     [0,       0,      0, 0,       0,      0]]

csQuartz = crystalFrame('32', [4.916, 4.916, 5.4054], 'X||a', 'Z||c', mineral='Quartz')

d = tensor(M, csQuartz, rank=3, doubleConvention=True, name='piezoelectric strain', unit='pC/N')
d
```

```text
tensor (Quartz)
  name            : piezoelectric strain
  unit            : pC/N
  rank            : 3 (3 × 3 × 3)
  doubleConvention: true
  tensor in compact matrix form
  -1.9222  1.9222  0  -0.1423       0       0
        0       0  0        0  0.1423  3.8444
        0       0  0        0       0       0
```

## Elastic stiffness: rank four

Linear elasticity relates the symmetric strain tensor $$\varepsilon$$ to
the symmetric stress tensor $$\sigma$$ through the stiffness tensor $$C$$.
The inverse relation uses the compliance tensor $$S$$:

$$ \sigma_{ij}=C_{ijkl}\,\varepsilon_{kl}, \qquad
   \varepsilon_{ij}=S_{ijkl}\,\sigma_{kl}. $$

Four indices give $$3^4=81$$ components before symmetry is considered.
Symmetric stress and strain reduce the component matrix to $$6\times6$$.
An elastic strain-energy function reduces the independent coefficients to
21 for triclinic symmetry, and crystal symmetry can reduce them further.
A cubic stiffness has only $$C_{11}$$, $$C_{12}$$, and $$C_{44}$$ independent.

```python
M = [[320, 50,  50,  0,  0,  0],
     [50,  320, 50,  0,  0,  0],
     [50,  50,  320, 0,  0,  0],
     [0,   0,   0,   64, 0,  0],
     [0,   0,   0,   0,  64, 0],
     [0,   0,   0,   0,  0,  64]]

csCubic = crystalFrame('m-3m')
C = stiffnessTensor(M, csCubic)
C
```

```text
stiffnessTensor (m3̅m)
  unit: GPa
  rank: 4 (3 × 3 × 3 × 3)
  tensor in Voigt matrix representation
  320   50   50   0   0   0
   50  320   50   0   0   0
   50   50  320   0   0   0
    0    0    0  64   0   0
    0    0    0   0  64   0
    0    0    0   0   0  64
```

## A tensor needs a reference frame

A reference frame is the coordinate system in which data are expressed.
It is distinct from symmetry and from the plotting convention that lays the
frame out on screen.

The crystal symmetries supplied to `d` and `C` also carry crystal frames.
For `d`, the alignment options state which Cartesian axes the published
quartz coefficients use.
Crystal symmetry states the point group under which a property is invariant.
It is attached to a reference frame but is not the frame itself.

Units and compact-matrix conventions are equally part of the data.
A plausible component matrix in the wrong frame or convention still gives a
plausible but physically wrong result.

## Seeing the cubic symmetry

[YoungsModulus](stiffnessTensor.YoungsModulus.html) evaluates the tensile
stiffness of a rod cut along every crystal direction.

```python
E = C.YoungsModulus()
plot(E, complete=True, upper=True)
mtexColorbar(title="Young's modulus in GPa")

youngsModulusRange = [min(E)[0], max(E)[0]]
youngsModulusRange
```

```text
[166.61157713039492, 306.4864864864865]
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/TensorDefinition-11.png"></center>

The printed range is 166.6 to 306.5 GPa for this illustrative tensor.
The plot is stiffest along the cube axes and softest along the body diagonals.
Its repeated fourfold pattern makes the attached cubic symmetry visible.

## Physically specific tensor classes

A typed class records what a tensor means and exposes only meaningful
operations. It may also set a default unit or compact-matrix convention.

| class | rank | physical meaning |
|---|---|---|
| [strainTensor](strainTensor.strainTensor.html) | 2 | strain $$\varepsilon$$ |
| [stressTensor](stressTensor.stressTensor.html) | 2 | stress $$\sigma$$ |
| [strainRateTensor](strainRateTensor.strainRateTensor.html) | 2 | strain rate $$E$$ |
| [velocityGradientTensor](velocityGradientTensor.velocityGradientTensor.html) | 2 | velocity gradient $$L$$ |
| [deformationGradientTensor](deformationGradientTensor.deformationGradientTensor.html) | 2 | deformation gradient $$F$$ |
| [spinTensor](spinTensor.spinTensor.html) | 2 | spin $$\Omega$$ |
| [curvatureTensor](curvatureTensor.curvatureTensor.html) | 2 | lattice curvature $$\kappa$$ |
| [dislocationDensityTensor](dislocationDensityTensor.dislocationDensityTensor.html) | 2 | dislocation density $$\alpha$$ |
| [refractiveIndexTensor](refractiveIndexTensor.refractiveIndexTensor.html) | 2 | refractive index |
| [ChristoffelTensor](ChristoffelTensor.ChristoffelTensor.html) | 2 | elastic wave propagation |
| [stiffnessTensor](stiffnessTensor.stiffnessTensor.html) | 4 | elastic stiffness $$C$$ |
| [complianceTensor](complianceTensor.complianceTensor.html) | 4 | elastic compliance $$S$$ |

[SchmidTensor](SchmidTensor.html) constructs a rank two tensor from a slip-plane normal
and a slip direction.

A component matrix constructs a typed tensor directly.

```python
M = [[0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 1]]

eps = strainTensor(M)
eps
```

```text
strainTensor (y↑→x)
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  0  0  0
  0  0  0
  0  0  1
```

Factory methods provide common physical states.
Here the displayed matrix is a unit uniaxial stress along z.

```python
sigma = stressTensor.uniaxial(zvector)
sigma
```

```text
stressTensor (y↑→x)
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  0  0  0
  0  0  0
  0  0  1
```

Specialized operations belong to the corresponding class.
For example, [calcShearStress](stressTensor.calcShearStress.html) acts on
a stress tensor and a slip system.

## Predefined tensors

MTEX provides constructors for arrays of ones, the rank two identity,
random tensors, and the rank three Levi-Civita tensor.
Random tensors are useful for numerical experiments, not as material data.

```python
Tones = tensor.ones(rank=2)
I = tensor.eye(rank=2)
Trandom = tensor.rand(rank=2)
leviCivita = tensor.leviCivita
```

The Levi-Civita components are zero when any two indices are equal.
They are $$+1$$ for even permutations of $$(1,2,3)$$ and $$-1$$ for odd ones.
This tensor represents the cross product in index notation.

## The maths behind a change of frame

The component array is a tensor because it obeys a specific transformation
law. If $$Q$$ changes an orthonormal basis, a rank $$r$$ tensor transforms as

$$ T'_{i_1\ldots i_r} =
Q_{i_1j_1}\cdots Q_{i_rj_r}T_{j_1\ldots j_r}. $$

Repeated indices are summed.
This law applies the frame change to every index and distinguishes a tensor
from an arbitrary multidimensional array.

A frame change re-expresses the same physical object in a different
reference frame and leaves the object itself untouched.
Rotating a tensor instead moves the physical property relative to the
specimen.
[Tensor Arithmetics](TensorArithmetics_py.html) demonstrates both operations and
the contractions that apply a tensor to vectors or other tensors.
