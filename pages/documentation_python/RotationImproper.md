<!--introduction-->

A proper rotation preserves lengths, angles, and handedness. An *improper rotation* also
preserves lengths and angles, but changes a right-handed object into its mirror image.
The name is historical: improper does not mean invalid, and such a transformation cannot
be made by physically turning a rigid object.

This page assumes the active action `rot * v` and the matrix representation introduced
in [Defining Rotations](RotationDefinition_py.html).

Proper and improper transformations together form the orthogonal group O(3). Its proper
part is the rotation group SO(3). MTEX stores both: a proper element is a
[rotation](rotation.rotation.html), and an orthogonalTransform
records which part an element belongs to with an inversion flag.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## The Inversion

The inversion sends every direction to its opposite. The named constructor is
[rotation.inversion](rotation.inversion.html).

```python
I = rotation.inversion
```

```python
I * vector3d.X
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
   x  y  z
  -1  0  0
```

The result is $$(-1,0,0)$$. Unary minus on a `rotation` toggles its inversion flag, so the
inversion can also be written as the negative identity.

```python
I == -rotation.id
```

```text
True
```

Do not confuse unary minus with [inv](quaternion.inv.html). `inv(turn)` undoes a turn,
whereas `-turn` combines the same proper part with the inversion. The first result below
is proper and the second is improper.

```python
turn = rotation.byAxisAngle(vector3d.Z, 30 * degree)
```

```python
cat(inv(turn), -turn).isImproper
```

```text
array([False,  True])
```

## Reflection in a Plane

A reflection leaves every direction in its mirror plane fixed and reverses the component
normal to the plane. In MTEX, [reflection](reflection.html) takes the plane normal as its
argument.

```python
planeNormal = vector3d(1, 1, 1)
mir = reflection(planeNormal)
```

The same transformation is a half turn about the plane normal followed by the
inversion.

```python
mir == -rotation.byAxisAngle(planeNormal, 180 * degree)
```

```text
True
```

The direction $$(1,-1,0)$$ is perpendicular to the normal and therefore lies in the mirror
plane. It is unchanged.

```python
mir * vector3d(1, -1, 0)
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  x   y  z
  1  -1  0
```

The plane normal is perpendicular to the mirror and changes sign.

```python
mir * planeNormal
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
   x   y   z
  -1  -1  -1
```

The grey patch below is the mirror plane. The black direction and its red image have
equal components within the plane and opposite components along the blue normal.

```python
n = normalize(planeNormal)
v = normalize(vector3d(1, -0.2, 0.5))
mirroredV = mir * v
```

```python
plot(plane3d(n, 0), faceColor=[0.75, 0.75, 0.75], edgeColor='none')
hold(True)
arrow3d(v, faceColor='black')
arrow3d(mirroredV, faceColor='red')
arrow3d(n, faceColor='blue')
hold(False)
```

## Parity under Composition

isImproper reports whether a transformation
reverses handedness. A single reflection is improper, whereas composing two reflections
restores handedness.

```python
mirrorX = reflection(vector3d.X)
mirrorY = reflection(vector3d.Y)
```

```python
cat(mirrorX, mirrorX * mirrorY).isImproper
```

```text
array([ True, False])
```

The two-reflection product is the proper half turn about Z. Their angular difference is
zero degrees.

```python
angle(mirrorX * mirrorY, rotation.byAxisAngle(vector3d.Z, 180 * degree)) / degree
```

## Improper Operations in Crystal Symmetry

Crystal point groups may contain both kinds of operation. For the mixed point group
$$\bar{4}m2$$, the displayed values are the total number of operations, the number of
proper operations, and the number of improper operations.

```python
cs = crystalFrame('-4m2')
ops = orthogonalTransform(cs)
improperFlags = ops.isImproper
```

```python
[len(ops), np.sum(~improperFlags), np.sum(improperFlags)]
```

```text
[8, 4, 4]
```

Only the proper operations are physical turns that superpose the crystal on itself.
[properSubGroup](symmetry.properSubGroup.html) retains those four operations. Do not
confuse it with [properGroup](symmetry.properGroup.html), which returns the associated
enantiomorphic group and has eight operations in this example.

```python
[len(rotation(cs.properSubGroup())), len(rotation(cs.properGroup()))]
```

```text
[4, 8]
```

## The Matrix Test

The matrix of every length-preserving linear transformation is orthogonal. Its
determinant is $$+1$$ for a proper rotation and $$-1$$ for an improper transformation.

```python
proper = rotation.id
improper = rotation.inversion
```

```python
np.array([det(matrix(proper)), det(matrix(improper))])
```

```text
array([ 1., -1.])
```

MTEX stores an improper transformation as a proper quaternion together with the
inversion flag. Axis-angle and Euler values therefore describe only that stored proper
part. Use `isImproper` or [matrix](rotation.matrix.html) when the handedness of the full
transformation matters.

## Next

[Operations](RotationOperations_py.html) covers composition, inversion, and action on
directions. [Crystal Symmetries](CrystalSymmetries_py.html) develops proper, Laue, and
mixed point groups and explains the difference between `properSubGroup` and
`properGroup`.

## Technical Details

Where MATLAB keeps the inversion flag on `rotation`, the port keeps a `rotation` proper
and carries the parity as the fifth coordinate of `orthogonalTransform`: `-r`,
`rotation.inversion` and `reflection(n)` are orthogonal transforms, `isImproper` is a
property of them, and a list mixing both kinds is one of them. MATLAB's `rotation(cs)`
over a mixed group is `orthogonalTransform(cs)` here; over a proper group `rotation(cs)`
works as well.
