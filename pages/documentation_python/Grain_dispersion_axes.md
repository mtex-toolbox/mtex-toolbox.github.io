<!--introduction-->

A grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected part of an EBSD map. It contains
many measured orientations rather than one exact orientation. When those orientations
follow one dominant rotation, they trace a fibre in orientation space. The axis of that
fibre is the grain's dispersion axis.

This page develops the construction for one grain and then repeats it over a map. Read
[Grain Reconstruction](GrainReconstruction_py.html) and
[Selecting Grains](SelectingGrains_py.html) first if grains and grain ids are new to you.
[Orientation Parameters](GrainOrientationParameters_py.html) introduces the grain mean,
GROD, and grain orientation spread.

A dispersion axis is an axis, not a directed vector. Its two ends are equivalent. Its
crystal-frame representation can constrain a deformation mechanism, while its
specimen-frame representation can constrain the kinematics. Neither interpretation
follows from the fit alone.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('forsterite')
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, minPixel=5)
```

## Find a grain with coherent intragranular rotation

First colour each forsterite measurement by its misorientation from the mean orientation
of its own grain. The hue gives the misorientation axis in the specimen frame, and the
saturation gives the angle. The reference orientation is supplied per measurement
through `ck.oriRef`.

```python
ck = axisAngleColorKey(ebsd['f'].CS)
ck.oriRef = grains['id', ebsd['f'].grainId].meanOrientation
plot(ebsd['f'], ck.orientation2color(ebsd['f'].orientations))

hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
plot(grains[['En', 'Di']], alpha=0.7)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grain_dispersion_axes-4.png"></center>

Pale grains have little rotation relative to their means. A grain with one strong hue
has rotated mainly about one specimen axis. Bands of two or three hues instead warn that
more than one axis may be active.

The white outline selects one large, strongly coloured grain. The rest of the
single-grain analysis asks whether its apparent axis survives a quantitative fit.

```python
grainSelected = grains(5095, 7803)
hold(True)
plot(grainSelected.boundary, lineWidth=3, lineColor='w')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grain_dispersion_axes-5.png"></center>

## See the dispersion in a pole figure

Start with a grid of crystal directions. Every orientation in the selected grain maps
every grid direction into the specimen frame. Each grid direction becomes a small cloud,
and how far that cloud spreads measures how much the intragranular rotation moves the
direction.

```python
s2G = equispacedS2Grid(resolution=15 * degree)
s2G = Miller(s2G, ebsd['f'].CS)
ori = ebsd[grainSelected].orientations
directions = ori.reshape(-1, 1) * s2G.reshape(1, -1)

plot(directions, markerSize=3, upper=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grain_dispersion_axes-6.png"></center>

At this scale the clouds all look alike. What separates them is how far each one
spreads, so colour every cloud by its mean angular deviation.

```python
poleDispersion = np.nanmean(angle(mean(directions, axis=0), directions, symmetry=False), axis=0)

plot(directions, np.tile(poleDispersion, (len(ori), 1)) / degree, markerSize=3)
mtexColorbar(title='average pole dispersion in degree')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grain_dispersion_axes-7.png"></center>

The darkest blue cloud moves least. A rotation leaves its own axis fixed, so that
crystal direction gives a grid-based estimate of the dispersion axis in the specimen
frame.

```python
idMin = np.nanargmin(poleDispersion)
axisGrid = grainSelected.meanOrientation * s2G[idMin]
hold(True)
annotate(axisGrid)
annotate(axisGrid, plane=True, lineStyle='--', lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grain_dispersion_axes-8.png"></center>

The dashed great circle is normal to the black axis. The streaks follow that circle, as
rotation about the axis requires. This construction is deliberately coarse: it can
return only one of the 15 degree grid nodes. The spacing is a sampling resolution, not a
15 degree uncertainty bound.

## Fit a fibre without a direction grid

Orientations produced by one continuous rotation lie on an
[orientation fibre](OrientationFibre_py.html). `fibre.fit` fits that curve directly. The
`'local'` algorithm is intended for a concentrated orientation cloud such as the
orientations inside one grain.

```python
fib = fibre.fit(ori, 'local')
fib
```

```text
fibre (Forsterite → y↑→x)
  h || r: [1̅2̅1] || (-12,-5,3)
```

The fitted fibre reports the same physical axis in two reference frames. `fib.h` is the
crystal direction and `fib.r` is the specimen direction.
[Reference Frame Alignment](EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) explains why the specimen
interpretation depends on a correctly calibrated frame.

```python
fib.h
```

```text
vector3d (Forsterite)
        u        v       w
  -0.0458  -0.0917  0.0465
```

```python
fib.r
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
       x       y      z
  -0.899  -0.377  0.225
```

```python
hold(True)
annotate(fib.r, markerFaceColor='r')
annotate(fib.r, plane=True, lineStyle='-.', lineWidth=2, lineColor='r')
hold(False)

gridFitDifference = angle(axisGrid, fib.r, antipodal=True) / degree
print(f'Grid axis to fitted axis: {float(np.asarray(gridFitDifference).reshape(-1)[0]):.1f} degree')
```

```text
Grid axis to fitted axis: 6.3 degree
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grain_dispersion_axes-12.png"></center>

The printed separation is smaller than the grid spacing. The black and red estimates
therefore agree at the resolution of the grid, while the fitted result is not restricted
to a grid node.

## Decide whether the grain really has one axis

A best fit always exists, even for a round cloud with no meaningful axis. The two
additional outputs from `fibre.fit` diagnose that case. `lam` contains the four
eigenvalues of the quaternion orientation tensor in ascending order. `fitAngle` is the
mean angular distance from the fitted fibre.

```python
fib, lam, fitAngle = fibre.fit(ori, 'local', diagnostics=True)

lam
```

```text
array([0.    , 0.0002, 0.0006, 0.9991])
```

```python
fitAngle / degree
```

```text
1.5419
```

The largest eigenvalue, $$\lambda_4$$, records overall concentration. The next,
$$\lambda_3$$, records extension along the fibre, while $$\lambda_2$$ records scatter away
from it. Their ratio is a useful screening statistic for this example.

```python
fibreRatio = lam[2] / lam[1]
fibreRatio
```

```text
3.5912
```

Here the printed ratio is well above one, so the cloud is more line-like than round. The
cutoff of three used below is a heuristic for this page, not a universal MTEX threshold.
A defensible cutoff also depends on EBSD angular precision, grain size, cleaning, and
the deformation expected.

Small-angle rotation axes are especially sensitive to EBSD error. Do not interpret a
stable-looking axis from a nearly uniform grain without first checking the angle scale
and the fit.

## Locate departures from the fitted fibre

The distance from each orientation to the fibre shows where the one-axis model works and
where it fails. The left panel shows the line in orientation space. The right panel
returns the same residual to the map.

```python
distanceFromFibre = angle(fib, ori) / degree
plot(ori, distanceFromFibre, all=True)
ax = gcm().children[-1]
ax.set_xlim(0, 30)
ax.set_ylim(20, 70)
ax.set_zlim(80, 120)
hold(True)
plot(fib, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)

nextAxis()
plot(ebsd[grainSelected], distanceFromFibre)
mtexColorbar(title='distance from fibre in degree')

print(f'Distance from fibre: median {np.nanmedian(distanceFromFibre):.2f} degree, 90th percentile '
      f'{np.nanquantile(distanceFromFibre, 0.9):.2f} degree, maximum {np.nanmax(distanceFromFibre):.2f} degree')
```

```text
Distance from fibre: median 1.41 degree, 90th percentile 2.51 degree, maximum 4.45 degree
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grain_dispersion_axes-16.png"></center>

Most points lie close to the fitted line. A band across the middle and the tail at the
bottom lie farther away. Those coherent residuals are where a single dispersion axis is
least adequate; they may record a second rotation or a subgrain boundary.

## Fit all sufficiently sampled grains

A fit is made separately for every forsterite grain with more than 100 measurements.
Small grains are excluded because their orientation clouds do not sample a fibre well
enough for this comparison.

```python
grainsLarge = grains['fo']
grainsLarge = grainsLarge[grainsLarge.numPixel > 100]

axisCrystal = np.full((len(grainsLarge), 3), np.nan)
axisSpecimen = np.full((len(grainsLarge), 3), np.nan)
fibreRatio = np.full(len(grainsLarge), np.nan)

for k in range(len(grainsLarge)):

  fib, lam, _ = fibre.fit(ebsd[grainsLarge[k]].orientations, 'local', diagnostics=True)

  axisCrystal[k] = fib.h.data.reshape(3)
  axisSpecimen[k] = fib.r.data.reshape(3)
  fibreRatio[k] = lam[2] / lam[1]

axisCrystal = Miller(vector3d(axisCrystal), grainsLarge.CS)
axisSpecimen = vector3d(axisSpecimen, frame=ebsd.frame)

isFibre = fibreRatio > 3
print(f'Large forsterite grains: {len(grainsLarge)}; ratio above three: {np.count_nonzero(isFibre)} '
      f'({100 * np.count_nonzero(isFibre) / len(grainsLarge):.1f} percent)')
```

```text
Large forsterite grains: 262; ratio above three: 147 (56.1 percent)
```

Only the grains that pass the stated screen enter the aggregate plots. The others are
not proved to have no physical rotation axis; this orientation data simply do not
support reporting one by this criterion.

## Compare axes in the specimen frame

The dots show individual antipodal axes. The contours show a kernel density estimate
with a 15 degree halfwidth. Its units are multiples of a uniform distribution, so one is
the uniform reference.

```python
specimenDensity = calcDensity(axisSpecimen[isFibre], halfwidth=15 * degree, antipodal=True)
maxSpecimenDensity, peakSpecimenAxis = specimenDensity.max()

plot(axisSpecimen[isFibre], contourf=True, antipodal=True, upper=True, halfwidth=15 * degree)
hold(True)
plot(axisSpecimen[isFibre], antipodal=True, upper=True, markerSize=4)
hold(False)
mtexColorbar()

print(f'Maximum specimen-axis density: {maxSpecimenDensity:.2f} multiples of uniform')
peakSpecimenAxis
```

```text
Maximum specimen-axis density: 2.22 multiples of uniform
vector3d (y↑→x)
  antipodal: true
      x      y     z
  0.946  0.248  0.21
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grain_dispersion_axes-18.png"></center>

The preference is mild rather than uniform. The axes avoid the centre of the projection,
which is the section normal, and gather near the rim towards X. They therefore tend to
lie in the section and point roughly east-west. Such a specimen-frame cluster can
indicate a common kinematic rotation axis, but calling it a vorticity axis requires the
geological and deformation context.

## Compare axes in the crystal frame

The crystal-frame plot asks a different question. A preferred crystal direction can
constrain a common rotation mechanism across differently oriented grains.

```python
crystalDensity = calcDensity(axisCrystal[isFibre], halfwidth=15 * degree)
maxCrystalDensity, peakCrystalAxis = crystalDensity.max()

plot(axisCrystal[isFibre], contourf=True, antipodal=True, fundamentalRegion=True, halfwidth=15 * degree)
mtexColorbar()

print(f'Maximum crystal-axis density: {maxCrystalDensity:.2f} multiples of uniform')
peakCrystalAxis = Miller(peakCrystalAxis, grainsLarge.CS)
peakCrystalAxis
```

```text
Maximum crystal-axis density: 2.83 multiples of uniform
vector3d (Forsterite)
  antipodal: true
  h       k       l
  0  8.2586  3.5141
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grain_dispersion_axes-19.png"></center>

This maximum is stronger and lies near [010], with density falling towards [100]. The
forsterite grains therefore bend about their own [010] direction more often than about
other crystal directions in this map. A rotation axis can narrow the candidate slip
mechanisms, but it does not identify a unique slip system without boundary geometry or
dislocation evidence.

Keep the two frames separate. A specimen-frame cluster supports a shared kinematic
frame, while a crystal-frame cluster supports a shared crystallographic mechanism. This
data set shows both preferences, with the crystal-frame preference the stronger of the
two.

## Next

[Grain Reference Orientation Deviation](EBSDGROD_py.html) develops the angle and axis of
every measurement relative to its grain reference.
[Axis Distribution Function](AxisDistributionFunction_py.html) treats axes of
grain-boundary misorientations and explains their symmetry and random references. The
next page in this chapter, [Grain Neighbours](GrainNeighbours_py.html), changes from
intragranular orientation structure to the network formed by adjacent grains.

## Technical details

`ori * s2G` over a list of orientations and a list of directions is the outer product
`ori.reshape(-1, 1) * s2G.reshape(1, -1)`, and the mean of the directions of every cloud
is `mean(directions, axis=0)`. The eigenvalues come as `lam[0]` to `lam[3]`, so MATLAB's
`lambda(3)/lambda(2)` is `lam[2] / lam[1]`. The measurements the closing absorbed carry
no orientation, so the statistics skip them with NumPy's `nan` forms.
