<!--introduction-->

A single rotation is best drawn by what it does, as in
[Defining Rotations](RotationDefinition_py.html). A set of rotations needs a different
picture. Each rotation becomes one point in a three-dimensional coordinate domain, with
the domain determined by the parametrisation.

This page assumes the axis--angle and Bunge Euler descriptions introduced in
[Defining Rotations](RotationDefinition_py.html). The geometric trade-offs between
coordinate systems are developed in [Rotation Representations](RotationRepresentations_py.html).

The plotting convention controls how the reference frame is laid out on screen. This
page uses y north and x east.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

```python
rot = rotation.rand(500)
```

## Euler Angle Space

[scatter](quaternion.scatter.html) places each rotation at its three Bunge Euler angles.
This is the default for rotations without crystal symmetry. The complete box spans
$$0\leq\varphi_1,\varphi_2\leq2\pi$$ and $$0\leq\Phi\leq\pi$$.

```python
scatter(rot, 'Bunge')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/RotationPlotting-5.png"></center>

The sample is uniform in rotation space, but its points are not uniform in this box.
Notice how the cloud thins near both $$\Phi=0$$ and $$\Phi=\pi$$. Equal-sized boxes at
different values of $$\Phi$$ represent different volumes of rotation space. Point density
in an Euler plot is therefore not itself a texture density.

## Axis--Angle Space

Axis--angle coordinates place a rotation at $$\omega\vec n$$. The direction $$\vec n$$ is
its rotation axis and the distance from the origin is its principal rotation angle
$$\omega$$.

```python
scatter(rot, 'axisAngle')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/RotationPlotting-6.png"></center>

The identity is at the centre and half turns lie on the outer sphere. Most of the points
lie beyond half the radius, because a uniform sample contains more large-angle rotations
than small-angle rotations. Opposite points on the outer sphere describe the same
$$180^\circ$$ rotation.

## Rodrigues--Frank Space

Rodrigues--Frank coordinates keep the direction $$\vec n$$ but change the distance from
the origin to $$\tan(\omega/2)$$.

```python
scatter(rot, 'Rodrigues', region=False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/RotationPlotting-7.png"></center>

Rotations near $$180^\circ$$ now lie far from the centre, so they stretch the plot and
compress the appearance of the remaining cloud. Half turns themselves are at infinity.
This domain makes fixed-axis rotations and symmetry boundaries simple, but it does not
preserve volume.

In all three plots, coordinate distance should not be read as the angular distance
between arbitrary rotations. Use [angle](quaternion.angle.html) for that comparison.
Homochoric and cubochoric coordinates preserve volume instead; see
[Rotation Representations](RotationRepresentations_py.html).

## Highlighting a Subset

The usual marker options can distinguish a selected subset. Here the red points are
rotations less than $$60^\circ$$ from the identity.

```python
threshold = 60 * degree
small = rot[rot.angle() < threshold]
```

```python
scatter(rot, 'axisAngle', markerFaceColor=[.7, .7, .7], markerSize=4)
hold(True)
scatter(small, 'axisAngle', markerFaceColor='r')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/RotationPlotting-9.png"></center>

The red points form a ball around the identity. Count them and report the fraction
rather than estimating either value from the figure.

```python
numSmall = len(small)
empiricalPercent = 100 * numSmall / len(rot)
numSmall, empiricalPercent
```

```text
(33, 6.6)
```

MATLAB's page quotes 20 of 500 rotations, or 4%, for its draw; the count above is this
build's draw. Sampling variation explains why neither equals the population value below.

## Why Uniform Rotations Look Nonuniform

Uniform means uniform with respect to the invariant, or Haar, measure on the rotation
group. In Bunge Euler angles its normalized volume element is

$$\mathrm{d}g = \frac{1}{8\pi^2}\sin\Phi\,\mathrm{d}\varphi_1\,\mathrm{d}\Phi\,\mathrm{d}\varphi_2.$$

The factor $$\sin\Phi$$ explains the emptying of the Euler box near its two $$\Phi$$ faces.
In axis--angle coordinates the fraction of all rotations with angle at most $$\omega$$ is

$$P(\Omega\leq\omega)=\frac{\omega-\sin\omega}{\pi}.$$

At $$60^\circ$$, this exact fraction is

```python
exactPercent = 100 * (threshold - np.sin(threshold)) / np.pi
exactPercent
```

```text
5.7669
```

The result is 5.7669%. Even this broad $$60^\circ$$ ball occupies only a small part of
rotation space. A scatter plot shows sampled coordinates; estimating a continuous texture
density requires [calcDensity](rotation.calcDensity.html).

## Next

An orientation combines a rotation with crystal and specimen symmetry. Its scatter plot
is restricted to a [fundamental region](OrientationFundamentalRegion_py.html) by default.
Dense orientation sets are usually clearer as sections through that region; see
[Section Plots](OrientationVisualizationSections_py.html).
