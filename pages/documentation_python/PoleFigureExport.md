<!--introduction-->

[export](PoleFigure.export.html) writes the sampled directions and intensities of a
`PoleFigure` to plain ASCII tables. This page exports measured data, reads it back, and
then exports pole figures recalculated from an orientation distribution function (ODF).

The tables are easy to exchange, but they are not a self-describing file format. Keep
the crystal and specimen frames, symmetries, angular unit, Miller indices, and
superposition coefficients with the files. Importing these quantities is introduced in
[Import Pole Figure Data](PoleFigureImport_py.html). The meaning of a pole figure is
explained in [Pole Figures](PoleFigureAnalysis.html).

```python
import glob
import os
import tempfile

import numpy as np
from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
pf = mtexdata('dubna')

pf
```

```text
PoleFigure (Quartz → y↑→x)
  h = {022̅1}, r = 72 × 19 points
  h = {101̅0}, r = 72 × 19 points
  h = {101̅1}{011̅1}, r = 72 × 19 points
  h = {101̅2}, r = 72 × 19 points
  h = {112̅0}, r = 72 × 19 points
  h = {112̅1}, r = 72 × 19 points
  h = {112̅2}, r = 72 × 19 points
```

## Start with measured pole figures

The Dubna quartz data set contains seven pole-figure entries. Its specimen frame is
drawn with Y pointing up and X pointing right.

The summary lists one row per entry. An entry may represent one crystal direction or a
superposition of directions whose diffraction peaks could not be resolved. The third
Dubna entry is such a superposition, so seven entries do not necessarily mean seven
individual reflections.

## Write one file per entry

Different pole figures may be measured on different specimen grids.
[export](PoleFigure.export.html) therefore writes each entry to a separate file instead
of assuming one common list of specimen directions. The file name combines the base name
below with the entry's Miller indices.

```python
# write into a temporary folder
fname = os.path.join(tempfile.mkdtemp(), 'dubna')
written = export(pf, fname, 'degree')
```

## Inspect the files

List the generated files, then show the beginning of the first table.

```python
d = sorted(glob.glob(fname + '_*.txt'))
print(f'Exported {len(d)} files:')
for name in d:
  print('    ' + os.path.basename(name))

preview = np.loadtxt(d[0])
print('Rows from three successive polar rings: angle, azimuth, intensity')
print(preview[[0, 1, 2]])
```

```text
Exported 7 files:
    dubna_{022̅1}.txt
    dubna_{101̅0}.txt
    dubna_{101̅1}{011̅1}.txt
    dubna_{101̅2}.txt
    dubna_{112̅0}.txt
    dubna_{112̅1}.txt
    dubna_{112̅2}.txt
Rows from three successive polar rings: angle, azimuth, intensity
[[  0.   180.     0.  ]
 [  5.   272.5    0.  ]
 [ 10.   275.02   0.  ]]
```

Every row has three columns: the polar angle of the specimen direction, its azimuth
angle, and the measured diffraction intensity. The `'degree'` option writes both angles
in degrees; without it, `export` writes radians.

The files contain numbers only. In particular, they do not contain column labels,
angular units, crystal or specimen symmetry, crystal-frame alignment, specimen-frame
identity, or superposition coefficients. The Miller indices appear in the file name, but
a naming convention is not a substitute for metadata. When sharing the tables, include a
script or README that records these choices and explains how specimen X, Y, and Z
correspond to the physical sample.

## Read the data back

The three columns are exactly those understood by
the generic reader of [loadPoleFigure](loadPoleFigure_generic.html). To reconstruct the object,
[PoleFigure.load](PoleFigure.load.html) also needs the Miller indices, crystal and
specimen symmetries, and superposition coefficients that were not stored in the tables.

```python
# reconstruct the file names from the Miller indices
fnames = [f'{fname}_{h.char()}.txt' for h in pf.allH]

pf2 = PoleFigure.load(fnames, pf.allH, pf.CS, pf.SS, superposition=pf.c,
                      columnNames=['polar angle', 'azimuth angle', 'intensity'])
pf2
```

```text
PoleFigure (Quartz → y↑→x)
  h = {022̅1}, r = 1368 points
  h = {101̅0}, r = 1368 points
  h = {101̅1}{011̅1}, r = 1368 points
  h = {101̅2}, r = 1368 points
  h = {112̅0}, r = 1368 points
  h = {112̅1}, r = 1368 points
  h = {112̅2}, r = 1368 points
```

## Check the round trip

ASCII output has finite decimal precision. Report the largest intensity change
introduced by writing and reading the tables.

```python
roundTripError = np.max(np.abs(pf.intensities - pf2.intensities))
print(f'Maximum absolute intensity change: {roundTripError:.3g}')
```

```text
Maximum absolute intensity change: 0
```

For these files the printed maximum intensity change is zero. The specimen directions
and intensities therefore survive to the printed precision. The regular
$$72 \times 19 = 1368$$ grid structure does not: each reloaded entry stores the same 1368
specimen directions as a plain list. This makes no difference to MTEX computations that
use those directions, but software that needs the original row-and-column layout must
reconstruct it from separately recorded acquisition information.

## Plot the reloaded data

```python
plot(pf2, figSize='small')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PoleFigureExport-6.png"></center>

The seven panels retain the measured bands, maxima, and angular coverage. A plot is a
useful check for swapped angle columns, wrong angular units, or a mismatched specimen
frame. It cannot reveal missing symmetry or superposition metadata when the numeric
values themselves are unchanged.

## Export recalculated pole figures

The same command exports pole figures computed from an ODF with
[calcPoleFigure](SO3Fun.calcPoleFigure.html). This is useful when another program needs
directional pole-density samples rather than the ODF itself.

```python
odf = calcODF(pf)

pfSim = calcPoleFigure(odf, pf.allH, pf.allR, superposition=pf.c)
```

Superposition coefficients must be passed explicitly. The third Dubna pole figure
combines $$(10\bar{1}1)$$ and $$(01\bar{1}1)$$ with the weights in `pf.c[2]`. Without them,
`calcPoleFigure` would average the two contributions with equal default weights and
calculate different intensities.

```python
recalculatedName = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(fname), 'dubnaRecalculated')
writtenSim = export(pfSim, recalculatedName, 'degree')
```

## Clean up

Remove the temporary files after the inspection and round-trip check.

```python
for name in glob.glob(fname + '_*.txt') + glob.glob(recalculatedName + '_*.txt'):
  os.remove(name)
```

## Choose the quantity to exchange

Export pole figures when the receiving program needs intensities or pole densities
sampled over specimen directions. If the starting quantity is an ODF, exporting only
selected pole figures discards information: a finite set of pole figures does not
determine an ODF uniquely. Use [ODF Export](ODFExport_py.html) when the receiving program
can accept an ODF or a discrete representation of it.

## Next

[ODF Analysis](ODFAnalysis.html) develops the continuous quantity usually reconstructed
from measured pole figures. Continue to [ODF Export](ODFExport_py.html) to compare its
component, grid, and discrete-orientation formats.

## Technical Details

`export` dispatches on the kind of object it is given, so the same verb writes a map, an
orientation list, an ODF or a pole figure data set; it returns the names it wrote. The
rows of a file run along the polar angle first, so the first three share an azimuth and
lie on three successive rings; MATLAB writes the same grid down its columns, where the
three successive rings are the rows 1, 73 and 145. The round trip is exact either way.
The generic reader takes degrees unless `radians=True` is given, where MATLAB needs
`'degree'` on reading too.
