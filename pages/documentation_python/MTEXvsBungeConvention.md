<!--introduction-->

MTEX defines an orientation as the coordinate map from the crystal frame into the
specimen frame. Bunge, and much of the literature following him, defines it in the
opposite direction: from the specimen frame into the crystal frame.

A *reference frame* is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. The *crystal
frame* is fixed to the lattice, while the *specimen frame* is fixed to the sample. Their
definitions are developed in
[Crystal Orientation as Coordinate Transformation](DefinitionAsCoordinateTransform_py.html).

This page assumes the Miller indices introduced in [Crystal Directions](CrystalDirections_py.html)
and the Euler angles from [Defining Rotations](RotationDefinition_py.html). Its purpose is
practical: translating orientation data and formulas between MTEX and sources that use
Bunge's map direction.

The two maps are inverses. This single fact explains the vector, matrix, and
misorientation formulas below.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

```python
cs = crystalFrame('m-3m')
reportedEuler = np.array([10, 50, 20]) * degree
ori = orientation.byEuler(reportedEuler, 'Bunge', cs)
h = Miller(1, 0, 0, cs, 'uvw')
```

## Which Way the Coordinates Travel

An MTEX orientation takes a crystal direction, here $$[100]$$, into specimen coordinates.

```python
r = ori * h
r
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
      x     y      z
  0.887  0.38  0.262
```

[rotate](vector3d.rotate.html) performs the same operation. The zero angular residual
confirms that the two forms agree.

```python
rotateResidual = angle(r, rotate(h, ori)) / degree
rotateResidual
```

```text
0
```

The Bunge map for the same physical orientation is the inverse map.

```python
ori_Bunge = inv(ori)
```

It takes the specimen direction `r` back into crystal coordinates.

```python
hBack = ori_Bunge * r
hBack.dispStyle = 'uvw'
hBack
```

```text
vector3d (m3̅m)
  u  v  w
  1  0  0
```

## A Visible Consequence of Using the Wrong Direction

Applying the inverse as though it were a crystal-to-specimen map places the crystal
differently. The red arrow marks the same crystal direction $$[100]$$ in both panels.

```python
cS = crystalShape.cube(cs)
bungeRotation = rotation(ori_Bunge)
rBunge = bungeRotation * vector3d(h)

mtexFig = newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 2], figSize='large')
plot(ori * cS, faceColor=[0.35, 0.6, 0.85])
hold(True)
arrow3d(0.9 * normalize(r), faceColor=[0.8, 0.15, 0.1])
hold(False)
text(-0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 'MTEX map', FontWeight='bold')

nextAxis()
plot(bungeRotation * cS, faceColor=[0.85, 0.45, 0.3])
hold(True)
arrow3d(0.9 * normalize(rBunge), faceColor=[0.8, 0.15, 0.1])
hold(False)
text(-0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 'Inverse map used forward', FontWeight='bold')
```

## The Reported Euler Angles Stay the Same

The word "Bunge" is used for two related choices. One is the direction of the
coordinate map compared on this page. The other is the Bunge Euler-angle sequence. MTEX
uses that Euler-angle sequence by default.

For the same physical orientation and the same crystal and specimen frames, copy a
reported Bunge Euler triple directly into MTEX. The MTEX angles of `ori` therefore
reproduce the input triple.

```python
mtexEuler = np.array([ori.phi1, ori.Phi, ori.phi2]) / degree
mtexEuler
```

```text
array([10., 50., 20.])
```

Do not instead ask MTEX for the angles of `ori_Bunge`. MTEX interprets that inverse as
another MTEX rotation and reports the inverse rotation's own Euler triple.

```python
inverseAsMtexEuler = np.array([ori_Bunge.phi1, ori_Bunge.Phi, ori_Bunge.phi2]) / degree
inverseAsMtexEuler
```

```text
array([160.,  50., 170.])
```

Thus the orientation object is inverted, but the three numbers used to describe the
same physical orientation are not. This design keeps MTEX Euler angles consistent with
common EBSD systems, simulation packages, textbooks, and papers.

## The Orientation Matrix Is Transposed

Let $$\mathbf{G}_{\mathrm{M}}$$ be the MTEX matrix and $$\mathbf{G}_{\mathrm{B}}$$ the Bunge
matrix for the same physical orientation. Since they represent inverse rotations,

$$ \mathbf{G}_{\mathrm{M}} = \mathbf{G}_{\mathrm{B}}^{-1}
   = \mathbf{G}_{\mathrm{B}}^{\mathrm{T}}. $$

The transpose equality holds because a rotation matrix is orthogonal. The MTEX matrix is

```python
mtexMatrix = ori.matrix()
mtexMatrix
```

```text
array([[ 0.8872, -0.4417,  0.133 ],
       [ 0.3797,  0.5355, -0.7544],
       [ 0.262 ,  0.7198,  0.6428]])
```

and the difference from the transpose of the Bunge matrix is zero.

```python
bungeMatrix = ori_Bunge.matrix()
matrixResidual = np.max(np.abs(mtexMatrix - bungeMatrix.T))
matrixResidual
```

```text
0
```

## Misorientations Come Out the Same

A misorientation is a coordinate map from one crystal frame into another. With MTEX
orientations the formula is

```python
ori1 = ori
ori2 = orientation.byEuler(70 * degree, 40 * degree, 35 * degree, 'Bunge', cs)

mori = inv(ori1) * ori2
```

With Bunge orientations the product has the opposite-looking formula.

```python
ori1_Bunge = inv(ori1)
ori2_Bunge = inv(ori2)

mori_Bunge = ori1_Bunge * inv(ori2_Bunge)
```

Substitution shows that the two inversions cancel. The comparison below deliberately
ignores crystal symmetry, so a symmetry-equivalent but different rotation could not
masquerade as equality.

```python
misorientationResidual = angle(mori, mori_Bunge, noSymmetry=True) / degree
misorientationResidual
```

```text
0
```

The tiny residual is floating-point roundoff. The misorientation map is therefore
unchanged. Its reported Euler angles are a separate convention: when converting a Bunge
misorientation triple, use the Euler angles of the inverse misorientation.

## A Practical Check

Before trusting imported orientations, establish all four convention choices: the
Euler-angle sequence, the map direction, the crystal frame, and the specimen frame. A
wrong choice still produces valid rotations and plausible plots.

The safest check is a known direction. Verify that one indexed crystal direction maps
to the specimen direction seen in the experiment. For file options, see
[Importing Crystal Orientations](OrientationImport_py.html). For the independent choice of
Cartesian crystal frame, see [The Crystal Reference System](CrystalReferenceSystem_py.html).

## Summary

| quantity | conversion from Bunge to MTEX |
|---|---|
| orientation Euler angles | unchanged |
| orientation matrix | transpose the matrix |
| any formula involving an orientation | invert each orientation |
| misorientation map | unchanged |
| misorientation Euler angles | use those of the inverse misorientation |

The practical consequence is precise. Euler angles may be copied when the source uses
the Bunge convention and the same crystal and specimen frames. A formula written for the
opposite coordinate-map direction still has to be translated.
