<!--introduction-->

Convolution combines two functions by averaging their overlap while one argument is
rotated. It is used to smooth a function, transfer an orientation distribution to
directions, and construct rotation-dependent similarities. A cross-correlation uses the
same machinery but may also require inversion or complex conjugation, depending on its
convention.

Four combinations occur in MTEX:

| first input | second input | result | compatibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SO3Fun` | `SO3Fun` | `SO3Fun` | first right = second left |
| `S2Fun` | `S2Fun` | `SO3Fun` | spherical frames must agree |
| `SO3Fun` | `S2Fun` | `S2Fun` | rotational left = spherical symmetry |
| `SO3Fun` or `S2Fun` | matching radial kernel | same domain as function |

The left and right sides are defined on
[Symmetry of Orientation-Dependent Functions](SO3FunSymmetricFunctions_py.html). Matching
means the same point group in the same reference frame, not merely point groups with the
same printed name.

```python
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Convolve two rotational functions

The inner sides are integrated out. Consequently, the right symmetry of the first function
must match the left symmetry of the second. The result inherits its left symmetry from the
first function and its right symmetry from the second.

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
g = SO3FunHarmonic.example()

ss1 = specimenFrame()
ss2 = specimenFrame('222')
centre = orientation.rand(1, ss1, ss2, rng=rng)
kernel = SO3DeLaValleePoussinKernel(halfwidth=15 * degree)
f = SO3FunRBF(centre, kernel)

c = conv(f, g)
c
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (Quartz → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 17
  mean     : 1
```

---

```python
resultLeftSymmetry = c.frameB
resultLeftSymmetry
```

```text
specimenFrame (specimen, y↑→x)
  symmetry: 222
  elements: 4
```

---

```python
resultRightSymmetry = c.frameA
resultRightSymmetry
```

```text
crystalFrame (⊙c→a)
  mineral        : Quartz
  symmetry       : 321
  elements       : 6
  a, b, c        : 4.916, 4.916, 5.405
  reference frame: X||a*, Y||b, Z||c
```

Here `f.frameA` and `g.frameB` are both the identity specimen symmetry. The result therefore
keeps the `222` left symmetry of `f` and the quartz right symmetry of `g`.

Check one value against direct numerical integration. The `SO3Fun` mean uses normalized
orientation-space measure, so it implements the factor $$1/(8\pi^2)$$ in the integral stated
below.

```python
r = orientation.rand(c.CS, c.SS, rng=rng)
convolutionValue = c.eval(r)
integrand = SO3FunHandle(lambda q: f.eval(rotation(q)) * g.eval(inv(rotation(q)) * r))
integralValue = mean(integrand, resolution=5 * degree)
SO3CheckDifference = abs(convolutionValue - integralValue)
print(f'convolution {convolutionValue:.4f}, integral {integralValue:.4f}, difference {SO3CheckDifference:.4f}')
```

```text
convolution 0.7023, integral 0.7041, difference 0.0018
```

---

```python
plot(c, 'sigma')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunConvolution-6.png"></center>

The strongest regions are shifted and broadened copies of the input ODF. The maximum drops
from about 94 to about 10, the bandwidth from 48 to 17, and the peak moves.

The plot covers the fundamental region of the inherited `222` and quartz symmetries, so
symmetrically equivalent copies are folded into it rather than drawn beside one another.
The printed difference measures the accuracy of the independent, coarser numerical
integration used for the check.

## Swap the argument order

Convolution on the rotation group is not commutative in general. A right-sided form can be
evaluated by swapping the function order, provided the new inner symmetry pair is
compatible.

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng(3)
fRight = SO3FunRBF(orientation.rand(1, g.CS, g.CS, rng=rng), kernel)
cRight = conv(g, fRight)
cRight
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (Quartz → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 17
  mean     : 1
```

---

```python
rRight = orientation.rand(cRight.CS, cRight.SS, rng=rng)
rightConvolutionValue = cRight.eval(rRight)
qRight = orientation.rand(100000, fRight.frameA.stripSym(), fRight.frameB.stripSym(), rng=rng)
rightSamples = fRight.eval(qRight) * g.eval(rRight * inv(qRight))
rightIntegralEstimate = np.mean(rightSamples)
rightStandardError = np.std(rightSamples, ddof=1) / np.sqrt(rightSamples.size)
rightCheckDifference = abs(rightConvolutionValue - rightIntegralEstimate)
print(f'convolution {rightConvolutionValue:.4f}, estimate {rightIntegralEstimate:.4f}, '
      f'standard error {rightStandardError:.4f}, difference {rightCheckDifference:.4f}')
```

```text
convolution 0.1909, estimate 0.1929, standard error 0.0018, difference 0.0019
```

This Monte Carlo estimate checks the right-sided integral written in the maths section.
Compare its difference with the printed standard error. It is not a claim that `conv(f,
g)` and `conv(g, f)` are generally equal.

Arrays of `SO3Fun` objects may also be convolved. Two arrays are combined element by
element, as described for [vector-valued rotational functions](SO3FunVectorValued_py.html).

## Convolve two spherical functions

Rotating one spherical function against another produces a function of the rotation, not
another spherical function. The output measures their overlap for every relative
orientation. Its right symmetry comes from the first spherical function and its left
symmetry from the second.

```python
cs = crystalFrame()
sphereF = S2FunHarmonic(S2Fun.smiley(), cs)
sphereG = S2FunHarmonic(S2DeLaValleePoussinKernel())
sphereCorrelation = conv(sphereF, sphereG)
sphereCorrelation
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (1 → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 25
  mean     : 0.006417
```

---

```python
rSphere = orientation.rand(sphereCorrelation.CS, sphereCorrelation.SS, rng=rng)
sphereConvolutionValue = sphereCorrelation.eval(rSphere)
sphereIntegrand = S2FunHandle(lambda v: sphereF.eval(inv(rSphere) * v) * sphereG.eval(v))
sphereGrid = equispacedS2Grid(resolution=1 * degree)
sphereIntegralValue = np.mean(sphereIntegrand.eval(sphereGrid))
sphereCheckDifference = abs(sphereConvolutionValue - sphereIntegralValue)
print(f'convolution {sphereConvolutionValue:.4e}, integral {sphereIntegralValue:.4e}, difference {sphereCheckDifference:.2e}')
```

```text
convolution -1.1909e-06, integral -1.1123e-06, difference 7.86e-08
```

---

```python
plot(sphereCorrelation, 'sigma')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunConvolution-11.png"></center>

The section plot changes as the smiley pattern moves into and out of alignment with the
zonal second function. This is why two inputs on the sphere produce an output on the
rotation group.

## Convolve a rotational and a spherical function

A rotational function can transport a spherical function through all orientations and
average the result. The output is spherical. The spherical symmetry must match the left
symmetry of the rotational function, and the output inherits the rotational function's
right symmetry.

```python
rotF = SO3FunHarmonic.example()
sphereH = S2FunHarmonic(S2Fun.smiley(), rotF.frameB)
directionF = conv(rotF, sphereH)
directionF
```

```text
S2FunHarmonic (Quartz)
  bandwidth: 48
  mean     : 0.006417
```

---

```python
vCrystal = Miller(1, 0, 0, directionF.frame)
directionValue = directionF.eval(vCrystal)

rng = np.random.default_rng(7)
qDirection = orientation.rand(100000, rotF.CS.stripSym(), rotF.frameB, rng=rng)
directionSamples = rotF.eval(qDirection) * sphereH.eval(qDirection * vCrystal)
directionIntegralEstimate = np.mean(directionSamples)
directionStandardError = np.std(directionSamples, ddof=1) / np.sqrt(directionSamples.size)
directionCheckDifference = abs(directionValue - directionIntegralEstimate)
print(f'convolution {directionValue:.4f}, estimate {directionIntegralEstimate:.4f}, '
      f'standard error {directionStandardError:.4f}, difference {directionCheckDifference:.4f}')
```

```text
convolution 0.0342, estimate 0.0340, standard error 0.0014, difference 0.0002
```

---

```python
plot(directionF)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunConvolution-14.png"></center>

Bright directions receive large contributions from many orientations where both input
functions are large. Unlike the preceding section plot, this result needs only a direction
on the sphere for evaluation.

The Monte Carlo orientations cover the full rotation group. `stripSym` removes the quartz
point group while retaining its crystal frame. Using a symmetry-reduced fundamental region
would be invalid for this check, because a fixed Miller representative makes the integrand
nonsymmetric. The check difference should be interpreted against its sampling standard
error, not as deterministic quadrature error.

## Use the inverse-action variant

A second convention acts on the spherical argument with the inverse rotation. It applies
when the rotational function has trivial left symmetry and its right symmetry matches the
spherical symmetry. Add `'inv'`, or equivalently invert the rotational function before
calling `conv`.

```python
sphereHInv = S2FunHarmonic(S2Fun.smiley(), rotF.CS)
directionInv = conv(rotF, sphereHInv, 'inv')
directionInvEquivalent = conv(inv(rotF), sphereHInv)

vSpecimen = xvector
inverseActionValue = directionInv.eval(vSpecimen)

rng = np.random.default_rng(5)
qInverse = orientation.rand(100000, rotF.CS.stripSym(), rotF.frameB, rng=rng)
inverseSamples = rotF.eval(qInverse) * sphereHInv.eval(inv(qInverse) * vSpecimen)
inverseIntegralEstimate = np.mean(inverseSamples)
inverseStandardError = np.std(inverseSamples, ddof=1) / np.sqrt(inverseSamples.size)
inverseActionCheckDifference = abs(inverseActionValue - inverseIntegralEstimate)
print(f'convolution {inverseActionValue:.4f}, estimate {inverseIntegralEstimate:.4f}, '
      f'standard error {inverseStandardError:.2e}, difference {inverseActionCheckDifference:.2e}')
```

```text
convolution 0.0148, estimate 0.0148, standard error 3.18e-04, difference 7.30e-05
```

---

```python
comparisonGrid = equispacedS2Grid(resolution=5 * degree)
inverseFlagDifference = np.max(np.abs(directionInv.eval(comparisonGrid) - directionInvEquivalent.eval(comparisonGrid)))
inverseFlagDifference
```

```text
0
```

The small final difference verifies that `'inv'` and `conv(inv(rotF), sphereHInv)`
implement the same variant. The two action conventions should not be mixed: $$qv$$ and
$$q^{-1}v$$ generally produce different averages.

## Smooth with a rotational kernel

An `SO3Kernel` is a radial rotational function: it depends only on the rotation angle.
Convolution with it attenuates harmonic degrees according to the kernel coefficients.
Radiality also makes this particular convolution commutative, even though convolution of
two general rotational functions is not.

```python
psi = SO3DeLaValleePoussinKernel(halfwidth=10 * degree)
smoothSource = SO3FunHarmonic(rotF, bandwidth=min(rotF.bandwidth, psi.bandwidth))
smoothF = conv(smoothSource, psi)
smoothFReverse = conv(psi, smoothSource)
kernelCommutationError = calcError(smoothF, smoothFReverse)
kernelCommutationError
```

```text
0
```

---

```python
plotSpectrum([smoothSource, smoothF], figSize='small')
legend('before convolution', 'after convolution')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunConvolution-18.png"></center>

The convolved spectrum lies below the original at higher harmonic degrees. Those degrees
encode rapid angular variation, so their attenuation is the spectral signature of
smoothing.

## Smooth with a spherical kernel

An `S2Kernel` is a zonal spherical function. Convolving an `S2Fun` with it produces another
`S2Fun` and smooths angular variation around every direction.

```python
sphericalSource = S2Fun.smiley()
phi = S2DeLaValleePoussinKernel(halfwidth=10 * degree)
sphericalSmooth = conv(sphericalSource, phi)
sphericalSmooth
```

```text
S2FunHarmonic
  bandwidth: 25
  mean     : 0.006417
```

---

```python
plot(sphericalSmooth)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SO3FunConvolution-20.png"></center>

The face remains recognizable, while the sharp boundaries of its features are softened by
the 10 degree kernel.

The same kernel can be regarded as a spherical function and convolved with
`sphericalSource` to produce an `SO3Fun`. The two results agree when the direction $$v$$ and
rotation $$R$$ satisfy $$v=R^{-1}e_3$$.

```python
v = vector3d.rand(rng=rng)
rKernel = rotation.map(v, zvector)
kernelAsFunction = S2FunHarmonic(phi)
sphericalOnSO3 = conv(sphericalSource, kernelAsFunction)
kernelFormDifference = abs(sphericalSmooth.eval(v) - sphericalOnSO3.eval(rKernel))
kernelFormDifference
```

```text

```

---

```python
xi = equispacedS2Grid(resolution=1 * degree)
sphericalKernelIntegral = np.mean(sphericalSource.eval(xi) * phi.eval(np.cos(angle(xi, v))))
sphericalKernelCheckDifference = abs(sphericalSmooth.eval(v) - sphericalKernelIntegral)
print(f'integral {sphericalKernelIntegral:.4f}, difference {sphericalKernelCheckDifference:.2e}')
```

```text
integral 0.1779, difference 4.64e-05
```

## The maths behind convolution

MTEX uses normalized Haar measure. If $$\mathrm{d}q$$ denotes the usual unnormalized measure
with volume $$8\pi^2$$, convolution of compatible rotational functions is

$$ (f*g)(R)=\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int_{\mathrm{SO}(3)}
f(q)g(q^{-1}R)\,\mathrm{d}q. $$

If $$f$$ has left symmetry $$S_L$$ and right symmetry $$S_x$$, while $$g$$ has left symmetry $$S_x$$
and right symmetry $$S_R$$, the result has left symmetry $$S_L$$ and right symmetry $$S_R$$.
Swapping the order gives the right-sided form

$$ (g*f)(R)=\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int_{\mathrm{SO}(3)}
f(q)g(Rq^{-1})\,\mathrm{d}q. $$

The sphere has volume $$4\pi$$. For two spherical functions, MTEX uses

$$ (f*g)(R)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\mathbb S^2}
f(R^{-1}\xi)g(\xi)\,\mathrm{d}\xi. $$

The two rotational--spherical actions are

$$ (f*h)(\xi)=\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int_{\mathrm{SO}(3)}
f(q)h(q\xi)\,\mathrm{d}q $$

and, with `'inv'`,

$$ (f*h)(\xi)=\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int_{\mathrm{SO}(3)}
f(q)h(q^{-1}\xi)\,\mathrm{d}q. $$

Finally, a zonal spherical kernel $$\psi$$ satisfies

$$ (f*\psi)(v)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\mathbb S^2}
f(\xi)\psi(\xi\mathbin{\cdot}v)\,\mathrm{d}\xi. $$

Regarding the kernel as the spherical function $$\psi(\xi\mathbin{\cdot}e_3)$$ instead gives
an `SO3Fun`. Its value at $$R$$ equals the spherical result at $$v=R^{-1}e_3$$. For an
`SO3Kernel`, $$\omega(q^{-1}R)=\omega(Rq^{-1})$$ explains the special commutativity.

Continue with [Vector-Valued Functions](SO3FunVectorValued_py.html) to apply the elementwise
array behaviour introduced above. The following [Rotational Vector Fields](SO3FunVectorField_py.html)
page extends the domain to vector-valued fields with a rotating tangent space.

## Technical Details

MATLAB's `S2FunHarmonicSym(sF, cs)` is `S2FunHarmonic(sF, cs)` here, a function in the
frame of its symmetry; the random draws are NumPy's, so the checks agree with MATLAB's in
kind, not in their digits. MATLAB's `smoothSource = rotF; smoothSource.bandwidth = …`
copies the function; the page builds the truncated copy with the constructor, since the
Python assignment would change `rotF` itself.
