<!--introduction-->

Crystal symmetry makes many crystal directions equivalent. A *fundamental sector* is a
patch of the unit sphere that contains a representative of every symmetry-equivalent
family. Its interior contains exactly one representative from each general family;
directions on the boundary need a qualification discussed below.

This page assumes the Miller notation from [Miller Indices](CrystalDirections_py.html) and
the equivalent-direction families from [Operations](CrystalOperations_py.html). The sector
is the domain of an [inverse pole figure](OrientationInversePoleFigure_py.html). It is also
the region into which `project2FundamentalRegion` maps crystal directions.

```python
from mtex import *
```

## A Cubic Example

For the cubic Laue group `m-3m`, the sector is the familiar spherical triangle with
corners at $$[001]$$, $$[101]$$, and $$[111]$$.

```python
cs = crystalFrame('m-3m')
corners = Miller([[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]], cs, 'uvw')
```

```python
plot(cs)
hold(True)
plot(cs.fundamentalSector(), color='red')
plot(corners, labeled=True, MarkerFaceColor='white', backgroundColor='w')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/FundamentalSector-3.png"></center>

The black symbols and lines show the symmetry elements. The red boundary encloses the
sector, and the three labelled directions identify its corners.

## How MTEX Stores the Sector

[sphericalRegion](sphericalRegion.sphericalRegion.html) represents the sector as an
intersection of spherical half-spaces.

```python
sR = cs.fundamentalSector()
sR
```

```text
sphericalRegion
  faces   : 3
  vertices: 3
```

The summary reports three edge normals, one for each side of the cubic triangle. They
are stored in `sR.N`.

```python
sR.N
```

```text
array([[ 0.7071, -0.7071,  0.    ],
       [-0.7071,  0.    ,  0.7071],
       [ 0.    ,  1.    ,  0.    ]])
```

For this sector, a direction $$\mathbf{v}$$ lies inside when every normal $$\mathbf{n}_i$$
satisfies $$\mathbf{n}_i \cdot \mathbf{v} \geq 0$$. The rows printed above are those
inward-pointing unit normals in the crystal reference frame.

## Testing and Projecting

Consider the Miller direction $$(231)$$.

```python
v = Miller(2, 3, 1, cs)
```

[checkInside](sphericalRegion.checkInside.html) tests it against all three half-spaces.

```python
isInside = sR.checkInside(v)
isInside
```

```text
False
```

The false result means that $$(231)$$ is outside the chosen sector. It does not mean that
its symmetry-equivalent family is absent.

[project2FundamentalRegion](vector3d.project2FundamentalRegion.html) selects an
equivalent representative inside the sector.

```python
vFundamental = v.project2FundamentalRegion()
vFundamental
```

```text
vector3d (m3̅m)
  h  k  l
  2  1  3
```

The result is $$(213)$$, a symmetry-equivalent permutation of the indices. Both directions
belong to the same $$\{123\}$$ form; the sector selects one representative from that
family.

---

```python
hold(True)
plot(v)
plot(vFundamental, MarkerFaceColor='red')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/FundamentalSector-9.png"></center>

The original marker lies outside the red triangle, while the filled red marker lies
inside it. Their different positions do not make them crystallographically distinct.

## Other Laue Groups

The exact point group determines the shape of the sector. Lower symmetry means fewer
equivalent copies and therefore a larger sector. Only point group `1` leaves the whole
sphere. The triclinic Laue group $$\bar{1}$$ already halves it because inversion
identifies every direction with its opposite. The other ten Laue groups are shown below.

```python
mtexFig = newMtexFigure(layout=[2, 5], figSize='medium')
for lId in range(2, 12):
  ax = mtexFig.nextAxis()
  cs = crystalFrame(LaueId=lId)
  plot(cs, parent=ax)
  hold(True)
  plot(cs.fundamentalSector(), parent=ax, color='red', lineWidth=3)
  hold(False)
  mtexTitle(cs.LaueName())
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/FundamentalSector-10.png"></center>

Each panel shows the symmetry elements of one Laue group and outlines its sector in
red. Within this gallery, the sector area is inversely proportional to the number of
symmetry operations. Moving from `6/mmm` to `2/m` enlarges the red patch by exactly the
factor by which the number of symmetry operations falls.

## Point Groups, Laue Groups, and Boundaries

A fundamental sector follows the point group supplied to MTEX. Adding the `antipodal`
option identifies $$\mathbf{v}$$ with $$-\mathbf{v}$$ and is equivalent to using the
corresponding Laue group. This distinction matters for a non-centrosymmetric crystal:
its point-group sector may be larger than its Laue-group sector.

The gallery uses Laue groups because conventional diffraction commonly identifies
Friedel pairs. MTEX does not impose that antipodal identification when a point group is
used without `antipodal`.

For a point group $$G$$, a general direction has $$\mathrm{ord}(G)$$ symmetry-equivalent
copies. The sector therefore covers the fraction $$1/\mathrm{ord}(G)$$ of the sphere, or
spherical area $$4\pi/\mathrm{ord}(G)$$. A direction fixed by a nonidentity operation has
fewer distinct copies and often lies on an edge or vertex.

Not every edge is a symmetry element. A closed sector can contain two equivalent
representatives on paired seam edges. Consequently, projection is unique in the
interior but a boundary tie may be resolved by either representative. Both answers are
crystallographically equivalent.

## Next

A sector is a purely geometric object and carries no orientation information. Its
counterpart for orientations is the [Fundamental Region](OrientationFundamentalRegion_py.html),
represented by an [orientationRegion](orientationRegion.orientationRegion.html). The
sector is also what an [inverse pole figure](OrientationInversePoleFigure_py.html) is drawn
on.

Continue in this chapter with [Quasi Symmetries](QuasiCrystals_py.html), where the same
construction reduces directions under non-crystallographic point groups.

## Technical Details

`fundamentalSector` is a method here, as it is computed from the group; `sR.N` is the
NumPy array of the edge normals, one per row. The Laue class by number is
`crystalFrame(LaueId=k)`.
