<!--introduction-->

A spherical function has no preferred flat view. The useful plot depends on the question
being asked.

Use colour for values and contours for level sets. Use three-dimensional shape, a planar
section, or harmonic content for other questions.

This page compares these views. Its examples use objects from
[Concept](S2FunConcept_py.html) and [Operations](S2FunOperations_py.html).

## Example functions

The examples use the smiley function for recognisable spatial features and an oscillatory
function for a more revealing planar section.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

# the smiley
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
sF1 = S2Fun.smiley()

# some oscillatory function
f = lambda v: 0.1 * (v.theta + np.sin(8 * v.x) * np.sin(8 * v.y))
sF2 = S2FunHarmonic.quadrature(f, bandwidth=150)
```

## Smooth colour plot

[pcolor](S2Fun.pcolor.html) draws function values as colour without contour lines. The
more general [plot](S2Fun.plot.html) command produces the same default view.

```python
plot(sF1)
mtexColorbar(title='function value')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunPlotting-2.png"></center>

The eyes and mouth appear as smooth colour regions. This view makes the spatial pattern
easy to recognise, and the colour bar translates colour into function value. The plot does
not mark particular value levels.

## Contour plots

[contour](S2Fun.contour.html) draws level lines. [contourf](S2Fun.contourf.html) fills
the regions between those lines.

```python
newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 2])
contour(sF1, upper=True)
mtexTitle('Contour lines')
nextAxis(1, 2)
contourf(sF1, upper=True)
mtexTitle('Filled contours')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunPlotting-3.png"></center>

Both panels trace the same levels on the upper hemisphere. The filled view makes their
ordering easier to read, while the line view leaves the underlying area unobscured.

## Freely rotatable 3D plot

[plot3d](S2Fun.plot3d.html) draws a three-dimensional view that can be rotated freely
with the mouse in an interactive figure.

```python
plot3d(sF1)
mtexTitle('Values on the sphere')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunPlotting-4.png"></center>

Here the radius stays fixed and colour carries the function value. This view reveals how
features continue around the sphere without changing the geometry to encode amplitude.

## Set the 3D camera

A [plotting convention](plottingConvention.html) specifies how a reference frame is laid
out on screen. Its `north` and `outOfScreen` directions provide a reproducible camera for
the static published view.

```python
how2plot = plottingConvention()
how2plot.north = yvector
how2plot.outOfScreen = vector3d(1, 0, 2)
setCamera(how2plot)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunPlotting-5.png"></center>

The camera now places the $$y$$ direction at the top and looks along the specified
combination of the $$x$$ and $$z$$ directions. The function itself has not been rotated.

## Radial surface plot

[surf](S2Fun.surf.html) transforms the radius of the sphere according to the function
value. Colour and radial displacement therefore encode the same value. By default MTEX
rescales a real scalar function before using it as radius. The rescaling keeps relative
variation visible.

```python
surf(sF1)
plt.gca().set_axis_off()
setCamera(how2plot)
mtexTitle('Values as radius and colour')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunPlotting-6.png"></center>

Peaks extend farther from the centre, while low values pull the surface inward. The
camera is unchanged, so this shape can be compared directly with the previous
three-dimensional view.

The `noScaling` flag skips the default rescaling. In that case the radial distance is the
absolute function value, which is useful only when the original magnitude makes a readable
surface.

## Planar section

[plotSection](S2Fun.plotSection.html) draws the intersection of the radial surface with a
plane. The normal vector `N` selects that plane.

```python
N = zvector
plotSection(sF2, N, color='interp', linewidth=10)
mtexColorMap('spring')
mtexTitle('Section in the xy plane')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunPlotting-7.png"></center>

With `N = zvector`, the section lies in the $$xy$$ plane. The repeated lobes expose the
oscillation from the sine factors more clearly than a single projected hemisphere would.

## Harmonic spectrum

[plotSpektra](S2FunHarmonic.plotSpektra.html) groups the spherical harmonic coefficients
by degree. This view describes frequency content rather than position on the sphere.

```python
plotSpektra(sF1, FontSize=15, linewidth=2, figSize='small')
plt.xlim(0, 40)
```

```text
(0.0, 40.0)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunPlotting-8.png"></center>

Low degrees describe broad variation. The non-zero coefficients at higher degrees supply
the sharper facial details. The horizontal axis is limited to degree 40 so that this
useful part of the spectrum is legible.

## Choose a view

Use a smooth colour plot to locate values. Use contours to compare levels. Use a radial
surface to emphasise amplitude. A section isolates one plane. The spectrum reveals
harmonic scale. The linked method pages list the more specific plot options for each
representation.

construct a spherical function from values at discrete directions and compare the
available representations.

## Technical Details

MATLAB's `colormap spring`, `axis off` and `xlim` are matplotlib's calls here:
`mtexColorMap('spring')`, `plt.gca().set_axis_off()` and `plt.xlim`. MATLAB's
`close all` between the figures has no counterpart; every plot opens its own figure.
