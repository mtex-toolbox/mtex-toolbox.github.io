<!--introduction-->

An EBSD map stores one measurement at each acquired position.
[Denoising](EBSDDenoising_py.html) changes noisy orientations without moving those
positions. [Filling Missing Data](EBSDFilling_py.html) supplies values at missing
positions while leaving the measurement grid unchanged.

This page considers the other operation: reading the map at positions that were not
measured, then sampling it on a different grid. MTEX uses nearest neighbours for this
operation. It does not average orientations.

The examples assume basic [EBSD selection](EBSDSelect_py.html) and the distinction
between a list and a [gridded EBSD map](EBSDGrid_py.html).

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('twins')
```

## Reading the Map at One Point

[interp](EBSD.interp.html) evaluates a map at arbitrary coordinates. It works with a
plain `EBSD` list, a phase subset, and a rotated or sheared map. The imported map in
this example happens to be a square grid.

```python
x = 30.5
y = 5.5

plot(ebsd, ebsd.orientations)
hold(True)
plt.plot(x, y, 'ko', markerfacecolor='w', markersize=7)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDInter-4.png"></center>

The marker identifies the requested position. It lies between the centres of the
coloured source pixels, so the result must be sampled from one of them.

```python
e1 = interp(ebsd, x, y)
e1
```

```text
EBSD (y↑→x)
  size: 1
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral    Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      1 (100%)      Magnesium  LightSkyBlue  6/mmm     Magnesium
  Id  Phase             orientation  bands   bc   bs  error  mad
   0      1  (162.9°,111.9°,306.1°)     10  160  255      0  0.4
  scan unit: um
  X × Y    : [30.5 → 30.5] × [5.5 → 5.5]
```

The summary shows a new, one-entry `EBSD` variable at the requested position. MTEX
finds the nearest source measurement and copies its phase, orientation, and per-pixel
properties.

The query is accepted only when the nearest measurement is no farther away than the
furthest corner of `ebsd.unitCell`. This circular distance cutoff is not a
polygon-containment test. A point beyond that reach returns as `notIndexed` instead of
being extrapolated, whether it is outside the map or sufficiently far inside a hole.

The `'xy'` selector also finds the nearest source measurement.

```python
e2 = ebsd['xy', x, y]
e2
```

```text
EBSD (y↑→x)
  size: 1
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral    Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      1 (100%)      Magnesium  LightSkyBlue  6/mmm     Magnesium
    Id  Phase             orientation  bands   bc   bs  error  mad
  3108      1  (162.8°,112.1°,186.1°)     10  160  255      0  0.4
  scan unit     : um
  X × Y         : [30.6 → 30.6] × [5.4 → 5.4]
  square lattice: spacing 0.3
```

For this point, both commands therefore report the same orientation.

```python
angle(e1.orientations, e2.orientations) / degree
```

```text
array([0.1268])
```

The zero-degree result confirms the match. The two EBSD summaries expose the important
difference: `e2` retains the source position and id, whereas `e1` sits at the requested
position and receives a new id.

With a list of query positions, `interp` returns one new entry per query in the same
order. That behavior makes resampling possible; `'xy'` remains a selector for original
measurements.

## Resampling onto a Different Grid

A unit cell describes the shape and scale of a grid. [gridify](EBSD.gridify.html)
derives its cell-to-cell translations, builds a lattice over the map extent, and reads
the nearest measurement at the new positions. Here the unit cell is twice as large and
rotated by 45 degrees.

```python
# unit cell of twice the size, rotated by 45 degrees
uC = rotate(2 * ebsd.unitCell, 45 * degree)

# resample the map on the new lattice
ebsdNewGrid = gridify(ebsd, unitCell=uC)
ebsdNewGrid
```

```text
EBSD (y↑→x)
  size: 108 × 109 grid
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral     Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  0      6059 (51%)    notIndexed
  1      5713 (49%)    Magnesium   LightSkyBlue  6/mmm     Magnesium
  properties    : bands, bc, bs, error, mad
  scan unit     : um
  X × Y         : [-20.79 → 70.43] × [-25.03 → 66.19]
  square lattice: spacing 0.6
```

---

```python
# plot only cells that received source data
plot(ebsdNewGrid['indexed'], ebsdNewGrid['indexed'].orientations)
ext = ebsd.extent()
plt.xlim(ext[0], ext[1])
plt.ylim(ext[2], ext[3])
```

```text
(0.0, 40.8)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDInter-9.png"></center>

Compare this figure with the first map. The orientation regions occupy the same
specimen positions, but their pixels are now coarser and tilted. The orientations
themselves have not been rotated. The specimen's grains also occupy the same physical
regions; only their rasterized outlines have changed.

The summary reports a 108 by 109 matrix. A tilted lattice needs a larger rectangular
matrix to cover the source extent, so its corner cells project beyond the map. Fewer
than half of the cells are indexed, which is why the plot excludes `notIndexed` cells.

## From a Hexagonal to a Square Grid

A custom unit cell can also change the grid type. The ferrite data was measured on a
hexagonal grid.

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↓→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('ferrite')

hexGridSize = ebsd.shape
hexGridSize
```

```text
(270, 234)
```

```python
plot(ebsd[0:50, 0:100], ebsd[0:50, 0:100].orientations)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDInter-11.png"></center>

The staggered pixel rows reveal the hexagonal sampling lattice. Their orientations are
measurements; the next figure only redraws those values on a different lattice.

A square cell with half the measurement spacing gives a drawing grid fine enough to
distinguish neighbouring source positions in this example. This smaller cell does not
improve the map's spatial resolution.

```python
# define a square unit cell
squnitCell = ebsd.dPos / 4 * vector3d([-1, -1, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 1, -1], 0)

# resample on the square lattice
ebsdS = ebsd.gridify(unitCell=squnitCell)

squareGridSize = ebsdS.shape
squareGridSize
```

```text
(808, 809)
```

```python
plot(ebsdS[0:150, 0:350], ebsdS[0:150, 0:350].orientations)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDInter-13.png"></center>

The result is a square grid with 808 by 809 cells in place of the 270 by 234 hexagonal
cells, about ten times as many. The stepped colour regions show that each new cell
repeats its nearest hexagonal measurement. No orientation was invented on the way.

## What Regridding Does Not Change

Resampling changes the array size and pixel outlines, not the acquisition step or the
spatial resolution of the experiment. Repeated cells are not independent measurements.
Keep the original map for quantitative counts, orientation statistics, and grain-size
measurements unless the analysis explicitly requires a new raster.

Every copied quality value still describes the original diffraction pattern. It is not
evidence that a pattern was acquired at the new cell. Use
[Filling Missing Data](EBSDFilling_py.html) to recover orientations at missing positions,
or [Denoising](EBSDDenoising_py.html) to reduce orientation noise. Neither task is
performed by `interp`.

## Next

[ODF Estimation](EBSD2ODF_py.html) turns measured map orientations into an orientation
distribution function. Use the measured map rather than a densified copy so repeated
cells do not acquire extra statistical weight.
