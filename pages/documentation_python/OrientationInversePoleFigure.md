<!--introduction-->

An inverse pole figure fixes a direction in the specimen and asks which crystal
direction points along it. It asks the [pole-figure](OrientationPoleFigure_py.html) question
in reverse. It is the natural view when one specimen direction is physically important.
Examples include the normal of a rolled sheet, a loading axis, and the surface normal of
an EBSD map.

This page assumes the crystal-to-specimen coordinate map from
[Theory](DefinitionAsCoordinateTransform_py.html) and the equivalent directions from
[Symmetry](OrientationSymmetry_py.html). It also assumes the projections from
[Spherical Projections](SphericalProjections_py.html). A *reference frame* is the coordinate
system in which data are expressed. The plotting convention below lays specimen Y upward
and specimen X right. It changes only the screen layout. It does not rotate the specimen
or re-express the data.

```python
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')

rng = np.random.default_rng(635)
cs = crystalFrame('321')

ori = orientation.rand(cs, rng=rng)
ori
```

```text
orientation (321 → y↑→x)
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1  Phi  phi2
  48.8  101   188
```

## Building One by Hand

Fix the specimen Z direction. The orientation maps crystal coordinates into specimen
coordinates, so its inverse maps this direction back into the crystal frame.

```python
r = vector3d.Z
```

---

```python
h = inv(ori) * r
h
```

```text
vector3d (321)
       h        k       i        l
  0.3721  -0.9715  0.5995  -0.1971
```

The displayed Miller indices are the crystal-frame coordinates of the specimen Z
direction. [symmetrise](vector3d.symmetrise.html) applies the crystal point group. It
returns every equivalent description.

```python
hSym = h.symmetrise()
symmetryCopyCount = len(hSym)
symmetryCopyCount
```

```text
6
```

The count is six for a general direction in point group 321. A direction on a symmetry
axis can have fewer distinct copies. Several operations may give the same result there.

Plot the copies in the [fundamental sector](FundamentalSector_py.html), the part of the
sphere that retains one representative from each equivalent family.

```python
plot(hSym, fundamentalRegion=True, MarkerFaceColor='red')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationInversePoleFigure-5.png"></center>

Notice one marker rather than six. Symmetry reduction maps all six copies onto the same
position in the sector. They describe one crystal direction family, not six
orientations.

## The Shortcut

[plotIPDF](orientation.plotIPDF.html) performs the inverse map, symmetrisation,
reduction, and projection for several specimen directions at once.

```python
plotIPDF(ori, [vector3d.X, vector3d.Y, vector3d.Z])
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationInversePoleFigure-6.png"></center>

The three sectors correspond to specimen X, Y, and Z. Each marker shows which crystal
direction lies along the axis named above its panel.

One marker does not determine the complete orientation. The plot loses rotation about
the aligned direction. Distinct orientations can therefore occupy the same inverse pole
figure position. Use [3D Plots](OrientationVisualization3d_py.html) or
[Section Plots](OrientationVisualizationSections_py.html) when that missing information
matters.

## A Population as Contours

For a population, `contourf` replaces the individual markers with a kernel density
estimate on the sphere. Construct 300 orientations within $$12^\circ$$ of the orientation
above. This gives the density a feature worth reading.

```python
oriPopulation = rotation.rand(300, maxAngle=12 * degree, rng=rng) * ori
populationSize = len(oriPopulation)
populationSize
```

```text
300
```

---

```python
plotIPDF(oriPopulation, [vector3d.X, vector3d.Y, vector3d.Z], contourf=True)
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationInversePoleFigure-8.png"></center>

Each panel now contains one concentrated lobe rather than one marker. Its position
changes because X, Y, and Z point along different crystal directions. The colour scale is
in multiples of a random distribution (m.r.d.). It is a density, not a percentage of
orientations at one point. Quantitative inverse pole densities from an ODF are developed
in [Inverse Pole Figures of an ODF](ODFInversePoleFigure_py.html).

## Seeing the Symmetry Copies

By default `plotIPDF` draws only the fundamental sector. The option `complete` ignores
that reduction, while `upper` restricts the result to the upper hemisphere.

```python
plotIPDF(oriPopulation, r, contourf=True, complete=True, upper=True)
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationInversePoleFigure-9.png"></center>

Notice that the one Z-direction lobe is repeated three times on this upper hemisphere.
The complete sphere would also contain the three copies in the lower hemisphere. The six
lobes are the point-group equivalents that the fundamental-sector plot folds onto one
another.

The `antipodal` flag makes the additional identification $$\mathbf{h}\sim-\mathbf{h}$$.
Use it only when the measurement or model cannot distinguish a crystal direction from
its opposite. This is a modelling choice, not another operation of point group 321. See
[Axes and Antipodal Symmetry](VectorsAxes_py.html).

If an orientation carries a nontrivial specimen symmetry, `plotIPDF` also applies it to
the fixed specimen direction. Crystal symmetry acts after the inverse map in the crystal
frame. Specimen symmetry acts before it in the specimen frame. See
[Specimen Symmetry](SpecimenSymmetry_py.html).

## Inverse Pole Figures and EBSD Colours

An [IPF map](EBSDIPFMap_py.html) uses the same construction point by point. A colour key
assigns a colour to each fundamental-sector position. The key uses one chosen specimen
direction. The map therefore inherits the same information loss. Equal colours do not by
themselves prove equal orientations.

## The Maths Behind an Inverse Pole Figure

Let $$\mathbf{O}$$ map crystal coordinates into specimen coordinates. Let $$\mathbf{C}$$ be
a crystal-symmetry operation, $$\mathbf{P}$$ a specimen-symmetry operation, and
$$\mathbf{r}$$ the fixed specimen direction. Every crystal direction represented by
`plotIPDF` has the form

$$ \mathbf{h} = \mathbf{C}\,\mathbf{O}^{-1}\mathbf{P}\,\mathbf{r},
   \qquad \mathbf{C} \in \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{c}}, \quad
   \mathbf{P} \in \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{s}}. $$

This example has identity specimen symmetry. The hand construction is therefore
$$\mathbf{h}=\mathbf{C}\mathbf{O}^{-1}\mathbf{r}$$. Reduction to the fundamental sector
keeps one representative of this family.

## Next

Continue with [3D Plots](OrientationVisualization3d_py.html). They retain the orientation
information that an inverse pole figure discards. The sector itself, and how symmetry
determines its shape, is [Fundamental Sector](FundamentalSector_py.html). Its counterpart
for whole orientations is the [Fundamental Region](OrientationFundamentalRegion_py.html). For
measured maps, continue with [IPF Maps](EBSDIPFMap_py.html).
