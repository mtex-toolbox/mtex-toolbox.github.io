<!--introduction-->

Mechanical stress creates electric displacement in a piezoelectric crystal. This is the
*direct piezoelectric effect*. An electric field can also create strain, which is the
converse effect.

The direct effect relates a symmetric stress tensor $$\sigma$$ to electric displacement
$$D$$ through the rank three piezoelectric strain tensor $$d$$:

$$ D_i = d_{ijk}\,\sigma_{jk}. $$

This page assumes the tensor rank and compact notation introduced in
[Defining Tensorial Properties](TensorDefinition_py.html). Read
[Importing Tensor Data](TensorImport_py.html) first for units, crystal frames, and the
`doubleConvention` used by the file below.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')

# define the quartz crystal symmetry and crystal frame
csQuartz = crystalFrame('32', [4.916, 4.916, 5.4054], 'X||a*', 'Z||c', mineral='Quartz')

# load the right-handed quartz piezoelectric strain tensor
quartzFile = mtexdatafile('quartzPiezo')
P = tensor.load(quartzFile, csQuartz, rank=3, name='piezoelectric strain', unit='pC/N', doubleConvention=True)

setMTEXpref('defaultColorMap', blue2redColorMap)
```

## Why crystal symmetry matters

A material-property tensor must be invariant under every operation of its crystal
point group. Inversion changes the sign of a polar rank three tensor. A
centrosymmetric crystal must therefore have $$d=0$$.

Piezoelectricity is allowed in 20 of the 32 crystallographic point groups: every
noncentrosymmetric group except `432`. Quartz belongs to point group `32`, so symmetry
permits the effect and repeats it about the threefold crystal axis.

Handedness remains important even though the point-group symbol is the same. Inverting
right-handed quartz produces left-handed quartz and reverses the piezoelectric tensor.
The filename identifies `P` as the right-handed form.

## The signed longitudinal response

[directionalMagnitude](tensor.directionalMagnitude.html) contracts the same unit
direction $$n$$ into all three indices:

$$ q(n) = d_{ijk}\,n_i n_j n_k. $$

For a uniaxial stress along $$n$$, $$q(n)$$ is the electric-displacement component along
that direction per unit stress. It is a signed longitudinal coefficient, not the
magnitude of the displacement vector.

```python
q = P.directionalMagnitude()

# plot one symmetry-reduced sector
plot(P)
mtexColorbar(title='longitudinal coefficient (pC/N)')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PiezoElectricity-4.png"></center>

The sector contains both positive and negative response. Blue and red therefore mean
opposite signs of the longitudinal component, not weak and strong polarization.

A rank three directional response is odd: $$q(-n)=-q(n)$$. Plotting both hemispheres
makes that sign reversal explicit.

```python
plot(P, 'complete', 'smooth', 'upper', 'lower')
mtexColorbar(title='longitudinal coefficient (pC/N)')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PiezoElectricity-5.png"></center>

The same threefold pattern occurs on the two hemispheres with red and blue exchanged at
antipodal directions. This is the sign reversal expected for an odd-rank tensor.

## A radial surface

[surf](S2Fun.surf.html) can use the absolute response as distance from the origin and
the colour as its sign. The `noScaling` option keeps the physical zero and the original
pC/N values.

```python
surf(q, noScaling=True)
mtexColorbar(title='longitudinal coefficient (pC/N)')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PiezoElectricity-6.png"></center>

The six lobes have the same radial magnitude in antipodal pairs, while their colours
have opposite signs. The surface meets the origin in directions where the longitudinal
response is zero.

## Planar sections

[plotSection](S2Fun.plotSection.html) draws the signed response as a polar radius in a
chosen plane. A negative radius is placed in the opposite direction, so each curve is
traced twice. Use the coloured hemisphere plots above, rather than these outlines, to
read the sign.

The basal plane is normal to z.

```python
plotSection(q, vector3d.Z)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PiezoElectricity-7.png"></center>

The basal section is a three-petal rose. Its threefold repetition is the clearest planar
expression of quartz point group `32`.

A vertical section normal to x has a different outline.

```python
plotSection(q, vector3d.X)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PiezoElectricity-8.png"></center>

This section is a single oval rather than a three-petal rose because its plane contains
the threefold z axis instead of cutting across it.

## A polycrystal average needs handedness

The Tongue quartzite data contain one orientation for each of 382 grains. Mainprice,
Lloyd, and Casey (1993) explain a decisive limitation of these measurements: routine
electron-channelling patterns did not determine the handedness of each quartz grain.
Every grain was indexed as right-handed. The paper therefore states that
piezoelectricity cannot be calculated from this orientation set.

```python
orientationFile = mtexdatafile('tongue')
ori = orientation.load(orientationFile, csQuartz, columnNames=['Euler 1', 'Euler 2', 'Euler 3'])

orientationCount = len(ori)
orientationCount
```

```text
382
```

The calculation below is still instructive as a counterexample. It uses
[calcTensor](orientation.calcTensor.html) to rotate the right-handed tensor by every
orientation and take their unweighted arithmetic mean. The result is an *apparent*
aggregate in which all 382 grains have been assumed to be right-handed. It is not a
prediction for the rock.

```python
apparentMean = ori.calcTensor(P)
qApparent = apparentMean.directionalMagnitude()

plot(apparentMean, 'complete', 'smooth', 'upper', 'lower')
mtexColorbar(title='apparent longitudinal coefficient (pC/N)')

# rows: the single crystal and the all right-handed average, columns: minimum, maximum
responseRanges = np.array([[q.min()[0], q.max()[0]], [qApparent.min()[0], qApparent.max()[0]]])
responseRanges
```

```text
array([[-2.3  ,  2.3  ],
       [-0.594,  0.594]])
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PiezoElectricity-10.png"></center>

The single-crystal range is -2.3000 to 2.3000 pC/N. Under the deliberately false
all-right-handed assumption, the range is -0.5940 to 0.5940 pC/N, or 25.8 percent of
the single-crystal extreme.

Differently oriented grains partly cancel, which explains the reduction. Unknown
left-handed grains can reverse additional contributions. Their number and orientations
are absent from this data set, so the apparent average cannot be corrected without new
handedness information.

## Next

[Birefringence](BirefringenceDemo_py.html) continues with a rank two optical property,
whose even rank makes its directional response antipodal.
[Tensor Averages](TensorAverage_py.html) develops Voigt, Reuss, and Hill estimates for
elastic stiffness and explains their mechanical assumptions.

## Technical Details

The quartz file of MATLAB's data folder is the sample data set `quartzPiezo` here and
the Tongue quartzite orientations the data set `tongue`, both fetched on first use.
`min` and `max` of a function on the sphere return the value and the direction where it
is attained, as MATLAB's two outputs.
