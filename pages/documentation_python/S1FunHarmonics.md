<!--introduction-->

A function on the circle assigns a value to an in-plane angle $$\rho$$. Its values repeat
after $$2\pi$$, so it is a $$2\pi$$-periodic function. Geometrically, its domain is also called
the one-dimensional sphere $$\mathbb{S}^1$$ or the one-dimensional torus.

The preceding [Spherical Harmonics](SphericalHarmonics_py.html) page introduced wave-like
basis functions on the sphere. On the circle, only one integer mode remains, and the
corresponding expansion is an ordinary Fourier series.

MTEX uses functions on the circle whenever a scalar quantity depends on an in-plane angle.
Typical examples are

* angular density distributions of grain long axes or other in-plane shape directions,
* distributions of grain-boundary segment directions, optionally weighted by their segment
  lengths,
* caliper and projection lengths as functions of the projection direction, and
* azimuth-angle distributions of three-dimensional directions.

## Start from an explicit formula

MTEX offers two complementary representations. An [S1FunHandle](S1FunHandle.S1FunHandle.html)
evaluates an explicit formula whenever a value is requested. An
[S1FunHarmonic](S1FunHarmonic.S1FunHarmonic.html) stores a finite set of Fourier
coefficients.

Begin with the formula

$$ f(\rho)=1+\frac{1}{2}\cos(2\rho). $$

Pass the Python function to `S1FunHandle`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

S1F = S1FunHandle(lambda rho: 1 + 0.5 * np.cos(2 * rho))
S1F
```

```text
S1FunHandle
  bandwidth hint: 1024
```

## Plot the same function in two ways

A polar plot places each value along its angle. A Cartesian plot unfolds the circle and
shows angle on the horizontal axis.

```python
plt.figure()
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1, projection='polar')
plot(S1F, lineWidth=2)
mtexTitle('Polar Plot')
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plot(S1F, lineWidth=2, polar=False)
mtexTitle('Cartesian Plot')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S1FunHarmonics-2.png"></center>

## Read the two views

The Cartesian view makes the two maxima over one full turn easy to count. The polar view
makes their opposite in-plane directions visible. Both panels show the same function, and
neither changes its representation.

## Construct a function from coefficients

Within `S1FunHarmonic`, the `fhat` property stores coefficients from mode $$-N$$ through
mode $$N$$. It therefore contains an odd number of entries, and the centre entry is the
constant mode.

As an example, the following Fourier coefficients describe the real-valued function
$$f(\rho)=4+\cos\rho+2\sin(2\rho)$$.

```python
fhat = [-1j, 0.5, 4, 0.5, 1j]
S1FCoeff = S1FunHarmonic(fhat)
S1FCoeff
```

```text
S1FunHarmonic
  bandwidth: 2
  mean     : 4
```

---

```python
coefficientMean = mean(S1FCoeff)
coefficientMean
```

```text
4
```

---

```python
plt.figure()
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1, projection='polar')
plot(S1FCoeff, lineWidth=2)
mtexTitle('Polar Plot')
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plot(S1FCoeff, lineWidth=2, polar=False)
mtexTitle('Cartesian Plot')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S1FunHarmonics-5.png"></center>

## Read the coefficient example

The two coefficients of magnitude $$0.5$$ form the cosine term. The outer imaginary
coefficients form the sine term. A real-valued function has conjugate coefficients in
opposite modes.

The centre entry is the mean value. In the vector as written it is 4, which is confirmed
by `coefficientMean`.

## Approximate a formula by a Fourier series

Constructing an `S1FunHarmonic` from an `S1FunHandle` computes the Fourier coefficients.
The `bandwidth` is the largest retained mode. A higher bandwidth generally improves the
approximation but also increases the computational cost.

Computations with bandwidth 1024 are still very fast in practice and usually provide a
good approximation. The much smaller bandwidth 20 is already sufficient for the smooth
function below.

```python
S1F = S1FunHandle(lambda rho: np.exp(np.cos(rho)))
S1FH = S1FunHarmonic(S1F, bandwidth=20)
S1FH
```

```text
S1FunHarmonic
  bandwidth: 20
  mean     : 1.266
```

---

```python
rhoCheck = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 1001)
maxApproximationError = np.max(np.abs(S1F.eval(rhoCheck) - S1FH.eval(rhoCheck)))
maxApproximationError
```

```text
2.1538e-14
```

---

```python
plot(S1F, lineWidth=2)
hold(True)
plot(S1FH, '--', lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
legend('S1FunHandle', 'S1FunHarmonic')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S1FunHarmonics-8.png"></center>

## Read the approximation

The solid formula and dashed Fourier approximation overlap throughout the circle. The
printed maximum error on the check grid is about $$10^{-14}$$, so the remaining difference is
at the scale of floating-point round-off.

## Fit values sampled at angles

A function is often known only at a finite set of angles.
[S1FunHarmonic.interpolate](S1FunHarmonic.interpolate.html) constructs a periodic
trigonometric polynomial from those samples. The result can be evaluated at arbitrary
angles, plotted, differentiated, or used in later computations.

The bandwidth sets the number of Fourier modes in the interpolation. It should be large
enough to resolve the measured angular variation. An unnecessarily large bandwidth can
introduce oscillations or amplify noise.

```python
rho = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 11)
values = 1 + np.cos(rho) + 2 * np.sin(2 * rho)

S1FI = S1FunHarmonic.interpolate(rho, values)
S1FI
```

```text
S1FunHarmonic
  bandwidth: 3
  mean     : 1
```

---

```python
sampleResidual = np.max(np.abs(S1FI.eval(rho) - values))
sampleResidual
```

```text
3.4361e-04
```

---

```python
plt.figure()
plt.plot(rho, values, 'x', label='samples')
hold(True)
plot(S1FI, lineWidth=2, polar=False, displayName='periodic fit')
hold(False)
legend()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S1FunHarmonics-11.png"></center>

## Read the sampled-data fit

The curve joins the angular trend and closes periodically between $$2\pi$$ and zero. The
default regularisation leaves a maximum residual of about $$3.4\cdot10^{-4}$$ at these
samples. Set bandwidth and regularisation deliberately when the data contain noise or
sharp changes.

## Smooth small-scale oscillations

A harmonic function obtained from measured or interpolated data can contain small-scale
oscillations or noise. [smooth](S1Fun.smooth.html) reduces those variations by
convolution with an [S1DeLaValleePoussinKernel](S1DeLaValleePoussinKernel.html).

The kernel halfwidth sets the angular scale of the smoothing. A small halfwidth preserves
more local detail. A larger halfwidth produces a smoother function.

```python
f = S1FunHandle(lambda rho: 1 + np.cos(rho) + 0.4 * np.cos(2 * rho) + 0.15 * np.sin(20 * rho) + 0.1 * np.cos(35 * rho))
f = S1FunHarmonic(f, bandwidth=64)

fSmooth = f.smooth(halfwidth=8 * degree)

plot(f, lineWidth=2, displayName='original')
hold(True)
plot(fSmooth, lineWidth=2, displayName='smoothed')
hold(False)
legend()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S1FunHarmonics-12.png"></center>

## Read the smoothing result

The original curve has fine ripples from modes 20 and 35. The smoothed curve suppresses
those ripples while retaining the broad mode-one and mode-two variation. Smoothing changes
the function, so the halfwidth should be reported with any derived peak direction or
density.

## Compute integrals and extrema

Standard operations apply directly to an `S1FunHarmonic`. Here `S1FH` is still the
bandwidth-20 approximation of $$\exp(\cos\rho)$$. [mean](S1Fun.mean.html) returns its mean
value, while [sum](S1Fun.sum.html) returns its integral over the circle.

```python
meanValue = mean(S1FH)
meanValue
```

```text
1.2661
```

---

```python
integralValue = sum(S1FH)
integralValue
```

```text
7.9549
```

[max](S1Fun.max.html) and [min](S1Fun.min.html) return both the extreme value and its
angular position.

```python
maxValue, maxPosition = max(S1FH)
minValue, minPosition = min(S1FH)
extremePositionsDegree = np.array([maxPosition, minPosition]) / degree
print(f'max {maxValue:.4f} at {extremePositionsDegree[0]:.1f}, min {minValue:.4f} at {extremePositionsDegree[1]:.1f}')
```

```text
max 2.7183 at 0.0, min 0.3679 at 180.0
```

## Read the operations

The mean is about 1.2661, and the integral is about 7.9549. Their ratio is $$2\pi$$. The
maximum is $$\mathrm e$$ at zero degrees, while the minimum is $$\mathrm e^{-1}$$ at 180
degrees.

## Estimate a density from angular data

Periodic functions also arise after density estimation from circular data. For example,
`rho` is the azimuth angle of a three-dimensional direction. Passing these angles with the
`periodic` option makes [calcDensity](calcDensity.html) return an `S1FunHarmonic`.

```python
v = vector3d.rand(1000)
fun = calcDensity(v.rho, periodic=True)
fun
```

```text
S1FunHarmonic
  bandwidth: 60
  mean     : 1
```

---

```python
densityMean = mean(fun)
densityMean
```

```text
1.0000
```

---

```python
plot(fun, lineWidth=2)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S1FunHarmonics-18.png"></center>

## Read the angular density

The directions were sampled uniformly, so the density fluctuates around a flat value
rather than forming a stable preferred direction. Its mean is one because `calcDensity`
normalizes the periodic density. A pronounced reproducible peak would instead indicate a
preferred azimuth.

## The maths behind the Fourier representation

A $$2\pi$$-periodic function can be represented as a weighted sum of sines and cosines.
MTEX uses the numerically convenient complex exponentials $$\mathrm e^{-\mathrm i k\rho}$$.
A finite series of bandwidth $$N$$ is

$$ f(\rho)=\sum_{k=-N}^{N}\hat f_k\,
\mathrm e^{-\mathrm i k\rho}, \qquad \rho\in[0,2\pi). $$

MTEX uses the coefficient convention

$$ \hat f_k=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}f(\rho)\,
\mathrm e^{\mathrm i k\rho}\,\mathrm d\rho. $$

The constant coefficient $$\hat f_0$$ is therefore the mean value,

$$ \operatorname{mean}(f)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}
f(\rho)\,\mathrm d\rho. $$

The integral returned by `sum` is

$$ \operatorname{sum}(f)=\int_0^{2\pi}f(\rho)\,\mathrm d\rho
=2\pi\,\operatorname{mean}(f). $$

periodic density functions to grain long-axis and shortest-caliper directions.

## Technical Details

MATLAB's `subplot(1,2,1)` becomes a polar axes when a polar plot goes into it; with
matplotlib the page asks for `projection='polar'`. The random directions are not seeded
as MATLAB's `rng default`, so the density differs from MATLAB's in its fluctuations.
