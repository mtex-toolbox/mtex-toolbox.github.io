<!--introduction-->

A map-processing method is easiest to test on a map whose answer is known in advance.
The [simulateEBSD](simulateEBSD.simulateEBSD.html) class constructs such a map one
feature at a time. It can add orientation noise, a low-angle boundary, or an orientation
gradient to a uniform field.

This makes it useful for checking [denoising](EBSDDenoising_py.html) and [KAM](EBSDKAM_py.html).
It also supplies known input for [GND](GND_py.html) and [WBV](WBV_py.html) calculations.
Synthetic and experimental examples appear in
[Hielscher et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576719009075).

First read about [orientations](OrientationDefinition_py.html) and
[misorientations](MisorientationTheory_py.html). The page also assumes familiarity with
[grain reconstruction](GrainReconstruction_py.html).

## What is being simulated

`simulateEBSD` constructs an `EBSD` variable containing positions, a phase, and
orientations. It does not generate diffraction patterns or model the detector, pattern
indexing, spatial distortion, or failed measurements. A program such as
[EMsoft](https://github.com/EMsoft-org/EMsoft) is needed for physics-based EBSD pattern
simulation.

The class is designed for a single-grain orientation field. Use the
[Neper interface](NeperInterface_py.html) when polycrystal topology matters.

## The object and its defaults

The object holds the map settings and the current simulated map. Its defaults specify
coordinate limits of 100 by 100 and a unit step size. They do not create a map or add
noise until the corresponding methods are called.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↓→x')

eS = simulateEBSD()
eS
```

```text
simulateEBSD
  xdim       100
  ydim       100
  stepSize   1
  CS         1 (kryptonite)
  noiseFun   None
  noiseMax   0.05°
  axS        (0, 1, 0)
  gradDir    (1, 0, 0)
  moriAngle  0.0974028°
  EBSDsim    none yet
```

## A uniform orientation field

Set the coordinate limit, crystal symmetry, and reference orientation. The method
`makeMap` then creates the `EBSD` variable in `eS.EBSDsim`.

```python
eS.xdim = 200
eS.CS = crystalFrame('mmm', mineral='Kryptonite')
eS.ori0 = orientation.byEuler(np.array([0, np.pi / 4, 0]) * degree, eS.CS)

eS.makeMap()
eS.EBSDsim
```

```text

  size: 100 × 200 grid
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral     Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      20000 (100%)  Kryptonite  LightSkyBlue  mmm       Kryptonite
  properties    : emptyProp
  scan unit     : um
  X × Y         : [1 → 200] × [1 → 100]
  square lattice: spacing 1
```

---

```python
ipfKey = ipfColorKey(eS.CS)
plot(eS.EBSDsim, ipfKey.orientation2color(eS.EBSDsim.orientations))
```

The summary reports 20,000 measurements of one indexed phase. The map has one colour
because every measurement carries `ori0` exactly. This is the known reference field to
which the following features are added.

## Adding orientation noise

Noise is a random rotation about a random axis in the specimen frame. `noiseFun` selects
a uniform or lognormal distribution of rotation angles. For `'logn'`, the sampled angles
are rescaled so that the largest equals `noiseMax`; `noiseMax` is not a parameter of a
lognormal distribution. The noise is drawn from `eS.rng`, a NumPy generator, and from a
fresh one when it is `None`; a seeded generator makes the page reproducible.

```python
eS.noiseFun = 'logn'
eS.noiseMax = 2 * degree
eS.rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
eS.addNoise()

noiseAngle = angle(eS.ori0, eS.EBSDsim.orientations) / degree
print(f'Noise deviation: median {np.median(noiseAngle):.2f} degree; 90th percentile '
      f'{np.quantile(noiseAngle, 0.9):.2f} degree; maximum {noiseAngle.max():.2f} degree')

plot(eS.EBSDsim, noiseAngle)
mtexColorbar(title='deviation from ori0 in degree')
```

```text
Noise deviation: median 0.04 degree; 90th percentile 0.13 degree; maximum 2.00 degree
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDSimulation-6.png"></center>

The deviation map shows many small rotations and a sparse long tail. Its printed maximum
reaches the requested 2°. The median and 90th percentile describe the reproducible sample
used here. This is orientation-level noise, not noise in simulated diffraction patterns.

## A known low-angle boundary

A step feature is specified by a misorientation axis in the specimen frame and a total
misorientation angle. `addFeature('singleStep')` rotates one stepped domain relative to the
other.

```python
eS.axS = yvector
eS.moriAngle = 3 * degree
eS.addFeature('singleStep')
```

```text
simulateEBSD
  xdim       200
  ydim       100
  stepSize   1
  CS         mmm (Kryptonite)
  noiseFun   'logn'
  noiseMax   2°
  axS        (0, 1, 0)
  gradDir    (1, 0, 0)
  moriAngle  3°
  EBSDsim    20000 measurements
```

Feature methods modify the orientations already in `eS.EBSDsim`. They therefore
accumulate: this 3° step is added to the noisy map rather than to a fresh uniform map.

The boundary segments name their pixels by id, `ebsdId`, while `domainID` is a mask over
the gridded map, so the mask is read through the ids of the map.

```python
newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 2])

plot(eS.EBSDsim, angle(eS.ori0, eS.EBSDsim.orientations) / degree)
mtexTitle('deviation from ori0')

# classify the known step as an inner boundary
grains = calcGrains(eS.EBSDsim, angle=[10 * degree, 1 * degree])
inDomain = np.zeros(eS.EBSDsim.size, dtype=bool)
inDomain[eS.EBSDsim.id.reshape(-1)] = eS.domainID.reshape(-1)
ids = grains.innerBoundary.ebsdId
isStepSegment = inDomain[ids[:, 0]] ^ inDomain[ids[:, 1]]
stepBoundary = grains.innerBoundary[np.flatnonzero(isStepSegment)]
boundaryAngle = stepBoundary.misorientation.angle() / degree
print(f'Inner boundary: {len(boundaryAngle)} segments; mean {boundaryAngle.mean():.2f} degree; '
      f'range {boundaryAngle.min():.2f} to {boundaryAngle.max():.2f} degree')

nextAxis()
plot(grains)
hold(True)
plot(stepBoundary, boundaryAngle, lineWidth=3)
hold(False)
setColorRange([2.75, 3.25])
mtexColorbar(title='boundary angle in degree')
```

```text
Inner boundary: 167 segments; mean 3.00 degree; range 2.62 to 3.43 degree
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDSimulation-8.png"></center>

The left map contains one domain scattered around `ori0` and another scattered around the
3° offset. The right map uses 10° as the grain-boundary threshold and 1° as the lower,
subgrain threshold. The connected field is one grain. Its known step is stored in
`innerBoundary`.

The narrow colour range makes variation along the boundary visible. The printed mean
stays close to the imposed 3°. Its range records the noise that was added before the
step. The count is the number of individual grain boundary segments along the stepped
feature. Other short entries in `innerBoundary` can be caused by neighbouring noise
rotations that differ by more than 1°. The `domainID` mask isolates the segments that
cross the feature whose true location is known.

Synthetic noisy maps are particularly useful when the imposed boundary is close to the
angular noise. See [Germain et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matchar.2014.10.007).

## Starting over with an orientation gradient

`makeMap` discards the accumulated features and restores a uniform field. For a
gradient, `gradDir` gives the direction of increase in the specimen frame. Here
`moriAngle` is the angle increment per spatial grid step, not the total angle used by
the step feature.

```python
eS.makeMap()
eS.axS = yvector
eS.gradDir = xvector
eS.moriAngle = 0.03 * degree
eS.addFeature('simpleGradient')

gradientAngle = angle(eS.ori0, eS.EBSDsim.orientations) / degree
print(f'Gradient deviation: {gradientAngle.min():.2f} to {gradientAngle.max():.2f} degree')

plot(eS.EBSDsim, gradientAngle)
mtexColorbar(title='deviation from ori0 in degree')
```

```text
Gradient deviation: 0.03 to 6.00 degree
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDSimulation-9.png"></center>

The colour changes smoothly from left to right because `gradDir` is `xvector`. With the
default unit step, each column adds 0.03° about `yvector`. The first column is already one
increment from `ori0` because the default map coordinates start at one.

Further gradients can be superposed by changing `axS`, `gradDir`, or `moriAngle` and
calling `addFeature('simpleGradient')` again. In contrast, `addFeature('circularSubgrain')`
applies `moriAngle` as one total rotation. It changes the orientations inside a circular
domain. Assign an existing map to `eS.EBSDsim` to start from measured or separately
generated data.
