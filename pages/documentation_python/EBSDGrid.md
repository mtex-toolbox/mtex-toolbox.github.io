<!--introduction-->

Most EBSD maps are measured on a square or hexagonal scan lattice. By default,
[EBSD.load](EBSD.load.html) keeps that structure: it returns a map on its square or
hexagonal grid whenever every measurement fits on one lattice. Otherwise it keeps the
measurements as a plain `EBSD` list and explains why.

This page assumes basic [EBSD selection](EBSDSelect_py.html) and
[plotting](EBSDPlotting_py.html). See [Select by Index](EBSDIndex_py.html) first if row and
column indexing is unfamiliar.

A scan lattice, a matrix layout, and a reference frame answer different questions. The
lattice says which measurements are neighbours. The layout says which specimen
directions the matrix indices follow. The reference frame says which axes the positions
and orientations are expressed in.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('twins')
ebsd
```

```text

```

The summary identifies `ebsd` as a square grid. Its 22879 measurements form a 137 by
167 matrix, with one entry per scan position. Apart from its matrix shape, it behaves
like any other `EBSD` variable.

```python
plot(ebsd['Magnesium'], ebsd['Magnesium'].orientations)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDGrid-4.png"></center>

The rectangular outline follows the square measurement grid. The four corners of one
pixel give the same information directly.

```python
ebsd.unitCell
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  size: 4
      x      y  z

  -0.15   0.15  0
  -0.15  -0.15  0
   0.15  -0.15  0
```

## What a Grid Is Good For

* Per-pixel data can be handed to image-processing and registration tools as a matrix,
  and `ebsd[i, j]` addresses one scan position.
* [Plotting](EBSDPlotting_py.html) and [denoising](EBSDDenoising_py.html) are considerably
  faster because the raster does not have to be reconstructed.

Matrix indexing means what it says. The measurement in row 49 and column 99, counted
from zero, is

```python
ebsd[49, 99]
```

```text
EBSD (y↑→x)
  size: 1
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral    Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      1 (100%)      Magnesium  LightSkyBlue  6/mmm     Magnesium
    Id  Phase             orientation  bands   bc   bs  error  mad
  8282      1  (155.8°,100.6°,239.3°)     10  149  133      0  0.7
  scan unit     : um
  X × Y         : [29.7 → 29.7] × [14.7 → 14.7]
  square lattice: spacing 0.3
```

In the default layout, the first matrix dimension follows the grid direction closest to
y. The second follows the direction closest to x. Both indices advance towards
increasing coordinates. Thus `ebsd[0, 0]` is the corner with the smallest coordinates,
and `ebsd[i, j]` is the j-th pixel in the i-th scan row.

This layout belongs to the map, not to the file traversal order. It is the same
whichever corner the acquisition started from.

A stored matrix is not required nearly as often as it once was. The
[orientation gradient](EBSD.gradientX.html), [curvature](EBSD.curvature.html),
[GND](EBSD.calcGND.html), and [fill](EBSD.fill.html) operate on the virtual lattice
derived by [lattice](EBSD.lattice.html). They also work on plain lists, phase subsets,
and arbitrarily aligned maps.

## Choosing the Layout

A matrix is useful for image processing only when it is stored the same way round as
the image. A forescatter or BSE image follows the order in which its detector wrote the
pixels. That order need not match the map. [Maps and Images](EBSDMapsAndImages_py.html)
compares a real map with SEM images of the same area.

`'columnMajor'` and `'rowMajor'` are the two layouts aligned with x and y. Both are
[gridLayout](gridLayout.gridLayout.html) objects. A layout names the row direction
first, in the same order as the shape of the array. Suppose an image's rows run against
x and its columns run along y, as for a detector mounted a quarter turn from the scan.

```python
gL = gridLayout(-xvector, yvector)
```

Handing that layout to `gridify` changes the matrix shape and ordering.

```python
ebsdI = gridify(ebsd, gL)
ebsdI
```

```text
EBSD (y↑→x)
  size: 167 × 137 grid
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral     Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame

  scan unit     : um
  X × Y         : [0 → 49.8] × [0 → 40.8]
  square lattice: spacing 0.3
```

The map records the layout in which it is stored.

```python
ebsdI.layout
```

```text
gridLayout
  row: (-1, 0, 0)
  col: (0, 1, 0)
```

Every per-pixel property follows the same layout. For this pair of layouts, band
contrast is related by a quarter turn.

```python
np.array_equal(ebsdI.bc, np.rot90(ebsd.bc))
```

```text
True
```

No value was resampled or invented. A transpose and flips are sufficient, so conversion
back to the original layout is exact.

```python
np.array_equal(gridify(ebsdI, ebsd.layout).bc, ebsd.bc)
```

```text
True
```

Layout changes storage, not the specimen. The positions and orientations are unchanged,
and the plotting convention still draws both maps in the same specimen frame.

```python
newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 2])
plot(ebsd, ebsd.bc)
mtexColorMap('gray')
mtexTitle('columnMajor')
nextAxis()
plot(ebsdI, ebsdI.bc)
mtexColorMap('gray')
mtexTitle('row against x, column along y')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDGrid-12.png"></center>

The same features occupy the same screen positions in both panels. Only the labels
describe a different order in memory.

## Data That Cannot Be Put on a Grid

A rectangular raster is faithful only when every measurement occupies a distinct site
of one lattice. If two measurements land in the same cell, one would be lost. MTEX
therefore keeps such data as a list and reports the problem rather than silently
dropping a measurement.

```python
ebsd = EBSD.load(mtexdatafile('eclogite'), eulerCorrection=rotation.byAxisAngle(zvector, 180 * degree))
ebsd
```

```text
Warning: the measurements span 15040 lattice cells but there are only 617 of them, so they do not form a grid; keeping the data as a list, call gridify explicitly for the raster anyway

```

The warning above says why the data stays a list. MTEX also keeps a list when the
positions are too irregular to span a sensible raster. You may request a list
independently of the data, either for one import,

    ebsd = EBSD.load(fname, grid=False)

or for the whole session.

    setMTEXpref('gridifyOnImport', False)

You may change representation later. `ebsd.flatten()` flattens a gridded map into a
list, while [gridify](EBSD.gridify.html) puts a list on its grid.

## Selecting a Subset Drops the Matrix Shape

Selecting a phase, region, or indexed measurements usually leaves a shape that is not
rectangular. The result is therefore a plain list, although every retained measurement
still lies on the original lattice.

```python
ebsd = mtexdata('twins')

ebsdMg = ebsd['Magnesium']
ebsdMg
```

```text
EBSD (y↑→x)
  size: 22833
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral    Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      22833 (100%)  Magnesium  LightSkyBlue  6/mmm     Magnesium
  properties    : bands, bc, bs, error, mad
  scan unit     : um
  X × Y         : [0 → 49.8] × [0 → 40.8]
  square lattice: spacing 0.3
```

Reapplying [gridify](EBSD.gridify.html) restores the matrix shape.

```python
ebsdMg = ebsd['Magnesium'].gridify()
ebsdMg
```

```text
EBSD (y↑→x)
  size: 137 × 167 grid
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral    Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      22833 (100%)  Magnesium  LightSkyBlue  6/mmm     Magnesium
  properties    : bands, bc, bs, error, mad
  scan unit     : um
  X × Y         : [0 → 49.8] × [0 → 40.8]
  square lattice: spacing 0.3
```

The variables `ebsd` and `ebsdMg` differ at the 46 positions that were not indexed. In
`ebsd` those are real measurements in the separate `'notIndexed'` phase: a diffraction
pattern was recorded but could not be indexed. Selecting magnesium removes those
measurements and creates gaps, meaning missing sites within scan lines.

After `gridify`, each gap is an empty lattice site in `ebsdMg`. Its orientation is
`NaN` and its id lies beyond the ids of the parent map, because no selected measurement
belongs there. It is not a notIndexed measurement.

```python
[np.sum(ebsd.id >= ebsd.size), np.sum(ebsdMg.id >= ebsd.size)]
```

```text
[0, 46]
```

The empty sites complete the rectangle. Row and column ranges can therefore select and
plot a rectangular subregion.

```python
plot(ebsdMg[49:100, 4:100], ebsdMg[49:100, 4:100].orientations)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDGrid-17.png"></center>

## Gridding Reorders the Measurements

[gridify](EBSD.gridify.html) does not preserve input order, and generally cannot. The
layout fixes the first matrix dimension to y, whereas `.ctf` and `.ang` files usually
write x fastest. Consequently, the k-th entry of the flattened grid is generally not
line k of the input file.

Nothing is lost. The `id` of every measurement keeps its number in the imported list,
the record MATLAB keeps as the property `oldId`. Its upper left corner shows
consecutive ids running along matrix rows.

```python
ebsd.id[0:3, 0:4]
```

```text
array([[  0,   1,   2,   3],
       [167, 168, 169, 170],
       [334, 335, 336, 337]])
```

The index `return_index=True` adds, MATLAB's second output of `gridify`, translates in
the other direction. In particular, `ebsdGrid.pos` at `newId` returns the gridded
positions in the order of the input list.

```python
ebsdGrid, newId = gridify(ebsd.flatten(), return_index=True)

np.array_equal(ebsdGrid.pos.flatten()[newId].data, ebsd.flatten().pos.data)
```

```text
True
```


This distinction matters only to code that depends on input order. Grain reconstruction
does not: [calcGrains](EBSD.calcGrains.html) returns the same grains from the list and
from the map.

## The Gradient

The orientation gradient, the incomplete Nye tensor, and the gradient form of the
weighted Burgers vector are computed on the virtual lattice. They therefore do not
require a stored matrix. The default integral form of the weighted Burgers vector is a
raster algorithm and grids internally.

A grid does no harm, so this example continues with `ebsdMg`. The result has the same
matrix shape as the map.

```python
gradX = ebsdMg.gradientX()

plot(ebsdMg, norm(gradX))
setColorRange([0, 4 * degree])
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDGrid-20.png"></center>

The colour field follows the same rectangular raster, including its empty sites. No
separate gridding step was needed for the derivative itself.

## Hexagonal Grids

The same principles apply to a hexagonal scan. MTEX imports it on its hexagonal grid
and provides the same row and column indexing.

```python
ebsd = mtexdata('copper')

grains = calcGrains(ebsd)

ebsd
```

```text
EBSD (y↑→x)
  size: 136 × 119 grid
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral  Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      16116 (100%)  Copper   LightSkyBlue  m-3m      Copper
  properties : confidenceindex, extra1, extra2, extra3, extra4, fit, grainId, imagequality, semsignal
  scan unit  : um
  X × Y      : [0 → 590] × [0 → 584.6]
  hex lattice: spacing 5
```

---

```python
plot(ebsd[0:20, 0:40], ebsd[0:20, 0:40].orientations, micronbar=False, edgeColor='black')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDGrid-22.png"></center>

The black cell edges reveal the alternating half-step offset between scan rows. The
matrix is rectangular even though its pixel footprints are hexagons.

## Switching from a Hexagonal to a Square Grid

Some external image-processing tools require square pixels. Passing a square `unitCell`
to [gridify](EBSD.gridify.html) resamples the hexagonal measurements onto such a grid.

```python
# define a square unit cell
unitCell = 2.5 * vector3d([-1, -1, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 1, -1], 0)

# use the square unit cell for gridify
ebsdS = ebsd.gridify(unitCell=unitCell)
ebsdS
```

```text
EBSD (y↑→x)
  size: 118 × 119 grid
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral  Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      14042 (100%)  Copper   LightSkyBlue  m-3m      Copper
  properties    : confidenceindex, extra1, extra2, extra3, extra4, fit, grainId, imagequality, semsignal
  scan unit     : um
  X × Y         : [0 → 590] × [0 → 585]
  square lattice: spacing 5
```

---

```python
# visualize the result
newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 2])
plot(ebsd, ebsd.orientations)
nextAxis()
plot(ebsdS, ebsdS.orientations)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDGrid-24.png"></center>

This operation differs fundamentally from restoring a map's own lattice. The new grid
sites do not coincide with the measured ones, so every site copies the values of the
nearest measurement. The left panel shows the measured hexagons; the right shows the
square pixels after resampling.

The square cell above has approximately the same size as the hexagonal one. Squares
cannot reproduce hexagonal outlines, so grain boundaries in the right panel are visibly
staircased. A smaller square cell reduces the size of the steps.

```python
# a smaller unit cell
unitCell = 0.5 * vector3d([-1, -1, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 1, -1], 0)

# use the small square unit cell for gridify
ebsdS = ebsd.gridify(unitCell=unitCell)
ebsdS
```

```text

```

---

```python
plot(ebsdS, ebsdS.orientations)
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDGrid-26.png"></center>

The smaller cells follow the original boundary more closely. They do not add spatial
resolution: every new orientation still comes from a nearest measured hexagon.
[Regridding and Interpolation](EBSDInter_py.html) develops this distinction in detail.

Pixels that remain notIndexed correspond to measurements that were not indexed in the
source map. [fill](EBSD.fill.html) may replace them by interpolation;
[smooth](EBSD.smooth.html) offers more sophisticated methods; see
[Filling Missing Data](EBSDFilling_py.html).

## Rotated Grids

Rotating a map rotates its unit cell together with its positions. The lattice therefore
survives, and the map remains on its square or hexagonal grid. Nothing needs repair or
interpolation.

```python
ebsdR = rotate(ebsd, 20 * degree)
ebsdR
```

```text
EBSD (y↑→x)
  size: 136 × 119 grid
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral  Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      16116 (100%)  Copper   LightSkyBlue  m-3m      Copper
  properties : confidenceindex, extra1, extra2, extra3, extra4, fit, grainId, imagequality, semsignal
  scan unit  : um
  X × Y      : [-198.5 → 554.4] × [0 → 750.3]

```

---

```python
plot(ebsdR, ebsdR.orientations)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDGrid-28.png"></center>

The map is turned on screen, while the object summary still identifies a hexagonal
grid. If the same data arrives as a plain list, `gridify` recovers the rotated lattice
without requiring axis alignment.

```python
gridify(ebsdR.flatten())
```

```text

  scan unit  : um
  X × Y      : [-198.5 → 554.4] × [0 → 750.3]
  hex lattice: spacing 5
```

## Robustness to Distorted Grids

EBSD is measured on a tilted specimen. Seen from a finite working distance, the far
edge is farther away and appears smaller. The measured positions can therefore depart
smoothly from any single rigid lattice. MTEX still reconstructs the underlying grid
indices of an [EBSD](EBSD.EBSD.html) object. This matters to `gridify` and to every
operation that needs neighbours, including [calcGrains](EBSD.calcGrains.html) and the
cell drawing of a map.

Grid reconstruction uses a local deformation model. MTEX first fits an ideal affine
grid. It then interpolates the local deviation between the measured positions and that
grid wherever a cell has no measurement. Thus a gap, a notIndexed hole, and the dummy
cells used to bound the map follow the measured distortion rather than an unrelated
rigid lattice.

These terms are distinct. A gap is a run of measurements removed from a scan line, such
as by selecting one phase. A hole is a connected notIndexed area inside the scanned
region. A dummy cell is a synthetic cell beyond the scanned edge; it has no id and never
becomes a grain.

The example uses a real map because the failure appears only when the map is
realistically wide. A small synthetic grid remains safe at distortion levels that already
misindex a wide map.

```python
ebsd = mtexdata('small')
```

[transform](EBSD.transform.html) moves every pixel and its unit cell. It leaves
orientations and all other per-pixel properties untouched. The command takes a
[spatialTransform](spatialTransform.html), which records the mapping as an object; see
[Spatial Transforms](EBSDSpatialTransform_py.html).

A tilt is a projective transform. Straight lines remain straight, but parallel lines need
not, and scale varies across the frame. Three values specify it: the surface tilt, the
working distance, and the point left in place. `byTilt` tilts about the x axis, so the
tilt angle foreshortens the map across that axis, along y. The working distance controls
perspective, which vanishes as that distance grows.

Here the tilt is known and imposed. Recovering an unknown tilt from two measured images
is the inverse problem. [spatialTransformTilt](spatialTransformTilt.html) fits it in
stages.

```python
theta = 20 * degree                                  # surface tilt
wd = 8 * (ebsd.pos.y.max() - ebsd.pos.y.min())       # working distance
centre = mean(ebsd.pos)                              # what the tilt leaves in place

distort = spatialTransformProjective.byTilt(theta, wd, centre)
distort
```

```text
spatialTransformProjective
  model       stage  parameters
  projective  ·      perspective (0, -1.31e-05)
```

The map is compressed along y, from 3000 to 2820 micrometres, while the x extent is left
alone by the tilt and only stretched by perspective. It tapers towards the edge that is
farther away.

```python
ebsdDistorted = transform(ebsd, distort)

plot(ebsdDistorted['Fo'], ebsdDistorted['Fo'].orientations)
hold(True)
plot(ebsdDistorted['En'], ebsdDistorted['En'].orientations)
plot(ebsdDistorted['Di'], ebsdDistorted['Di'].orientations)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDGrid-32.png"></center>

The following pair measures the imposed distortion in cell units. Its first value is the
maximum pixel displacement. Its second is the largest residual after the best affine
grid has been removed.

```python
pos0 = ebsd.pos.data.reshape(-1, 3)[:, :2]
posD = ebsdDistorted.pos.data.reshape(-1, 3)[:, :2]
ijD = ebsdDistorted.lattice.ij.astype(float)
isIndexed = ebsdDistorted.isIndexed.reshape(-1)
affineDesign = np.column_stack([np.ones(len(ijD)), ijD])
affineFit = np.linalg.lstsq(affineDesign[isIndexed], posD[isIndexed], rcond=None)[0]
cellSize = ebsd.lattice.dxy
distortionInCells = np.array([np.linalg.norm(posD - pos0, axis=1).max(),
                              np.linalg.norm(posD - affineDesign @ affineFit, axis=1).max()]) / cellSize
distortionInCells
```

```text
array([2.48  , 0.8041])
```

Every pixel has moved by up to 2.48 cells. Once the affine foreshortening is removed,
0.80 cell remains. That is enough for a rigid reconstruction to round a pixel onto its
neighbour's site. Even so, the same grid indices are recovered as for the undistorted
map.

```python
np.array_equal(ebsdDistorted['Fo'].lattice.ij, ebsd['Fo'].lattice.ij)
```

```text
True
```

Drawing each measurement as its unit cell shows the result. The cells form one
continuous deformed mesh, with no cell sheared independently of its neighbours. A rigid
reconstruction would make the mesh wavy and would give
[calcGrains](EBSD.calcGrains.html) the wrong neighbours.

```python
plot(ebsdDistorted['Fo'], ebsdDistorted['Fo'].orientations, edgeColor='black')
hold(True)
plot(ebsdDistorted['En'], ebsdDistorted['En'].orientations, edgeColor='black')
plot(ebsdDistorted['Di'], ebsdDistorted['Di'].orientations, edgeColor='black')

# grain reconstruction consequently sees the distorted map as the same neighbourhood graph
grains = calcGrains(ebsdDistorted, minPixel=3)
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, simplify=False)

plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)

The boundary overlay remains closed and follows the tapered map. No duplicated or
missing grain strips appear along its edges.

## Next

[Maps and Images](EBSDMapsAndImages_py.html) uses layouts to compare an EBSD map with
detector images pixel by pixel. [Regridding and Interpolation](EBSDInter_py.html) develops
resampling onto a different lattice. [Spatial Transforms](EBSDSpatialTransform_py.html)
introduces the transform models used above, and
[TrueEBSD Distortion Correction](EBSDTrueEbsd_py.html) fits them to measured images.
Continue with [Grain Reconstruction](GrainReconstruction_py.html) when the goal is to turn
measurements into grains.
