<!--introduction-->

A grain boundary is stored as short segments between neighboring EBSD pixels that belong
to different grains. A value attached to each segment can therefore be drawn as the
colour of that short line.

The right colour encoding depends on the value. A misorientation angle is one number and
needs a colorbar. A misorientation axis is a direction and needs a direction key. The
full misorientation has three parameters and needs a key for rotation space.

This page assumes that the map has already been divided into
[grains](GrainReconstruction_py.html). See
[Select Grain Boundaries](BoundarySelect_py.html) for choosing segments and
[Theory of Misorientations](MisorientationTheory_py.html) for the angle-axis description
used below.

```python
import numpy as np
from mtex import *
```

```python
# import the data in its specimen reference frame
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('forsterite')

# restrict the map to a subregion of interest
ebsd = ebsd[inpolygon(ebsd, np.array([5, 2, 10, 5]) * 1000)]

# reconstruct grains with an explicit 15 degree threshold
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=15 * degree, minPixel=5, alpha=10)

# ebsdId is used below, so keep each segment tied to its measured pixel pair
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 4, simplify=False, refine=False)
```

## One colour for every boundary

With no data argument, [plot](grainBoundary.plot.html) draws all boundary segments in
one colour on top of the phase map.

```python
gB = grains.boundary

plot(ebsd)
hold(True)
plot(gB, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundaryPlots-3.png"></center>

## The misorientation angle

The misorientation angle is the smallest rotation angle relating the two crystal
orientations. It is a useful first separation between low-angle boundaries within
deformed grains and high-angle boundaries between grains.

```python
gB_Fo = grains.boundary['Fo', 'Fo']

plot(grains, translucent=1, micronbar='off')
legend('off')
hold(True)
plot(gB_Fo, gB_Fo.misorientation.angle() / degree, lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
mtexColorbar(title='misorientation angle (°)')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundaryPlots-4.png"></center>

The colour is nearly constant along each boundary and changes between neighboring
grains. The angles run from 15.9 to 108.8 degrees, with a median of 56.4 degrees.

Nothing below 15 degrees can appear because grain reconstruction used that threshold.
Every segment in `gB_Fo` is therefore a high-angle boundary by construction.
[Subgrain Boundaries](SubGrainBoundaries_py.html) shows how to retain and plot the
low-angle boundaries inside grains.

## The misorientation axis in crystal coordinates

The axis is a direction, so a colorbar would be meaningless. Expressed in crystal
coordinates, it identifies lattice directions about which the neighboring crystals are
rotated.

Crystal symmetry gives several equivalent descriptions of the same axis.
[HSVDirectionKey](HSVDirectionKey.html) folds them into one fundamental sector and
assigns one colour to each direction there.

```python
# axes in the forsterite crystal frame
axesCrystal = gB_Fo.misorientation.axis()

# construct the key and convert each axis to RGB
axisKey = HSVDirectionKey(axesCrystal)
axisColor = axisKey.direction2color(axesCrystal)

plot(grains, translucent=1, micronbar='off')
legend('off')
hold(True)
plot(gB_Fo, lineColor='black', lineWidth=6)
plot(gB_Fo, axisColor, lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundaryPlots-5.png"></center>

The black underlay keeps pale colours visible against the map. Read each boundary colour
from the direction key below, not from a numerical colorbar.

```python
plot(axisKey)
hold(True)
plot(axesCrystal, markerFaceAlpha=0.1, markerEdgeAlpha=0.3, markerFaceColor='black')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundaryPlots-6.png"></center>

The black points show which part of the key the measured axes use. Their clusters reveal
preferred crystal directions that are difficult to see from the coloured boundary map
alone.

## The misorientation axis in specimen coordinates

The same axis can be expressed in the specimen reference frame. It then describes how
the two lattices are related in space rather than which crystal direction is involved.

The misorientation stored on a segment is a crystal-to-crystal rotation, so it no longer
contains the specimen frame. The two measured orientations on either side are needed,
and `ebsdId` leads back to them.

```python
plot(grains, translucent=1, micronbar='off')
legend('off')
hold(True)
plot(gB_Fo, axisColor, lineWidth=4)

# boundary segments are in walk order, so sample every fifth one
gB_sample = gB_Fo[::5]

# retrieve the two measured orientations beside each sampled segment
ori = ebsd['id', gB_sample.ebsdId].orientations

# compute the same axes in the specimen reference frame
axesSpecimen = axis(ori[:, 0], ori[:, 1], antipodal=True)

quiver(gB_sample, axesSpecimen, autoScaleFactor=0.4, color='black')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundaryPlots-7.png"></center>

Sampling every fifth segment keeps the arrows readable without changing the boundary
map. Because segments are stored in walk order, the arrows remain distributed along the
boundary chains.

Each line is the projection of an axis into the measurement surface. A short line is
therefore not a small rotation. It is an axis pointing steeply out of the section plane.

Symmetry reduction can also make neighboring segments choose different equivalent axes,
especially near the largest possible misorientation angle.
[Misorientations at Grain Boundaries](BoundaryMisorientations_py.html) explains how to
recognize that jump.

## Colouring the whole misorientation

Angle and axis together are three parameters.
axisAngleColorKey maps all three to a single
RGB colour: the axis through the direction key of the whole sphere and the angle through
the saturation.

```python
plot(grains, micronbar='off')
legend('off')

foKey = axisAngleColorKey(gB_Fo.misorientation.CS, gB_Fo.misorientation.SS)
foColor = foKey.orientation2color(gB_Fo.misorientation)

hold(True)
plot(gB_Fo, lineColor='black', lineWidth=7)
plot(gB_Fo, foColor, lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundaryPlots-8.png"></center>

Two segments with the same colour now have the same misorientation, axis and angle
alike, rather than merely the same angle. The black underlay again separates pale
boundary colours from the phase map.

A three-parameter key cannot be displayed in one flat legend. MTEX shows axis angle
sections, each at a fixed misorientation angle, and draws the measured misorientations
on top.

```python
plot(foKey, 'axisAngle', sections=12, layout=[3, 4], figSize='large')
plot(gB_Fo.misorientation, markerFaceColor='none', add2all=True, markerSize=4)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundaryPlots-9.png"></center>

The forsterite misorientations fill the large-angle sections and leave the small-angle
sections nearly empty. A preferred boundary relationship would instead appear as points
gathered in one part of the key, with the corresponding colour repeated across the map.

## A material with preferred boundary relationships

The iron sample below provides that comparison. Its plotting convention is reset
explicitly because this specimen uses a different reference frame from the forsterite
map.

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↓→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('csl')

# reconstruct and smooth the grains
grains = calcGrains(ebsd)
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 2)
gB = grains.boundary['iron', 'iron']

# plot image quality beneath a translucent orientation map
with np.errstate(divide='ignore'):
  logIq = np.log(ebsd.prop['iq'])
plot(ebsd, logIq, figSize='large', colormap='black2white', colorRange=[0.5, 5])

hold(True)
plot(grains, grains.meanOrientation, faceAlpha=0.4)

# colour the boundaries by their full misorientation
ironKey = axisAngleColorKey(gB.misorientation.CS, gB.misorientation.SS)
ironColor = ironKey.orientation2color(gB.misorientation)
plot(gB, ironColor, lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundaryPlots-10.png"></center>

Whole boundaries now repeat one colour instead of changing continually along their
length. One colour recurs across the map, so many boundaries share one misorientation.
These are special boundaries, and [CSL Boundaries](CSLBoundaries_py.html) identifies their
relationships.

```python
plot(ironKey, 'axisAngle', axisAngle=np.arange(5, 61, 5) * degree, layout=[4, 3], figSize='large')

moriSample = discreteSample(gB.misorientation, 300, withoutReplacement=True)

plot(moriSample, add2all=True, markerFaceColor='none', markerEdgeColor='w')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/BoundaryPlots-11.png"></center>

The sections confirm the clustering: 300 measured misorientations occupy a few small
parts of the key instead of filling the available space. A misorientation and its
inverse are drawn at the same place because they describe the same boundary viewed from
opposite sides.

## What the colours do not describe

The colour contains the full three-parameter misorientation, not the full grain-boundary
character. Two further parameters specify the boundary-plane orientation. A
two-dimensional EBSD map measures only the plane trace and cannot recover its
inclination from one boundary.

The same colour therefore does not by itself imply the same boundary energy, structure
or chemistry. See [Grain Boundaries](GrainBoundaries.html) for the five-parameter
description and [Boundary Normal Distribution](BoundaryNormalDistribution_py.html) for what
can be inferred from many traces.

## Technical Details

MATLAB colours a complete misorientation with `PatalaColorKey`, which is not ported; the
page uses `axisAngleColorKey` instead. Both spend one colour on each misorientation, so
the reading of the two figures is the same, but the colours themselves differ and the
Patala key's grain-exchange construction is not reproduced.

`ebsd['id', M]` returns one measurement per entry of the matrix `M`, in its shape, so
the two columns of `ebsdId` give the two orientation lists. `axis(o1, o2)` is their
misorientation axis in the specimen frame. `gB_Fo[::5]` is MATLAB's `gB_Fo(1:5:end)`.
