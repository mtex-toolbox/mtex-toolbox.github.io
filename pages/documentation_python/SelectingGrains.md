<!--introduction-->

A `grain2d` variable is a list of grains. Selecting grains means indexing that list by
position, phase, property, spatial coordinates, or mean orientation. Every selection is
another grain list, so selections can be applied one after another.

This page assumes that you have reconstructed grains as described in
[Grain Reconstruction](GrainReconstruction_py.html). It also assumes that you can draw them
as in [Plotting Grains](GrainSpatialPlots_py.html).

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
# load sample EBSD data set
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('forsterite')

# restrict it to a subregion of interest
ebsd = ebsd[ebsd.inpolygon(np.array([5, 2, 10, 5]) * 1e3)]

# reconstruct grains; their ids are stored with the measurements
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=5 * degree, minPixel=5, alpha=6)

# smooth the boundaries
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 5)

# plot forsterite by orientation
plot(ebsd['Fo'], ebsd['Fo'].orientations, ipfDirection=zvector)

# plot the other two phases in grey
hold(True)
plot(ebsd['En'], faceColor='lightgray')
plot(ebsd['Di'], faceColor='darkgray')
plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-3.png"></center>

The black network outlines every reconstructed grain. The forsterite measurements
retain their orientation colours, while the two minor phases are grey so that later
highlights remain easy to see.

## By mouse

In MATLAB, `selectInteractive` installs a mouse callback on the current figure. A click
selects one grain, and additional clicks extend the selection, and the global variable
`indSelected` stores the selected positions in the current grain list. There is no mouse
selection in this port; the same result comes from the grain at a known coordinate, whose
position in the list `id2ind` looks up from its id.

```python
indSelected = grains.id2ind(grains(9000, 3500).id)

mouseGrains = grains[indSelected]
mouseGrains
```

```text
grain2d (y↑→x)
  size: 1
  Phase  Grains          Mineral     Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      1 (323 pixels)  Forsterite  LightSkyBlue  mmm       Forsterite
  boundary segments: 87, inner: 0, triple points: 6
        Id   Phase  Pixels        meanRotation         GOS
        26       1     323     (131°,64°,250°)     0.00795
```

```python
hold(True)
plot(mouseGrains.boundary, lineWidth=4, lineColor='gold')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-5.png"></center>

The gold outline marks the selected grain. If several grains had been clicked, every
selected outline would be gold and `mouseGrains` would contain all of them.

## By position

The expression `grains(x, y)` returns the grain containing the point `(x, y)` in map
coordinates. It needs neither a figure nor a mouse click.

```python
x = 12000
y = 4000

hold(True)
plot(grains(x, y).boundary, lineWidth=4, lineColor='blue')
plt.plot(x, y, marker='s', markerfacecolor='k', markersize=10, markeredgecolor='w', label='A')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-6.png"></center>

Marker A lies inside the thick blue outline. The coordinate is used for the lookup; its
location in the current axes does not affect the result.

## By phase

A grain is phase-homogeneous. A mineral name therefore selects every grain of that
phase, and the displayed summary reports what came back.

```python
forsteriteGrains = grains['forsterite']
forsteriteGrains
```

```text
grain2d (y↑→x)
  size: 61
  Phase  Grains             Mineral     Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      61 (14010 pixels)  Forsterite  LightSkyBlue  mmm       Forsterite
  boundary segments: 2819, inner: 12, triple points: 133
```

The mineral name is the readable form of a condition on `phase`. This property stores
one imported phase number per grain.

```python
firstFivePhase = grains[0:5].phase
firstFivePhase
```

```text
array([1, 1, 1, 1, 3])
```

## By a property

A grain property has one value per grain. NumPy operations on arrays can therefore build
indices from any such property. We begin with `area`.

```python
grainArea = grains.area

plot(grains, grainArea)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-9.png"></center>

Large grains are bright and small grains are dark. This map shows where the extremes lie
before any threshold is imposed.

`np.argmax` returns the position of the largest value in the list. That position is an
index, not a persistent grain ID.

```python
maxIndex = np.argmax(grainArea)
maxArea = grainArea[maxIndex]
maxArea
```

```text
4.0983e+06
```

```python
maxIndex
```

```text
38
```

```python
hold(True)
plot(grains[maxIndex].boundary, lineColor='red', lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-12.png"></center>

The red outline encloses the brightest grain in the area map. Sorting generalises this
selection from one grain to the largest few.

```python
sortedIndex = np.argsort(-grainArea)

# select the second to fifth largest grains
hold(True)
plot(grains[sortedIndex[1:5]].boundary, lineColor='orange', lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-13.png"></center>

The orange outlines mark ranks two through five. The largest grain remains identifiable
by its red outline from the preceding selection.

## By a condition

A logical array with one value per grain can index the list directly. Here it selects
every grain at least one quarter the size of the largest.

```python
condition = grainArea > maxArea / 4

hold(True)
plot(grains[condition].boundary, lineColor='yellow', lineWidth=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-14.png"></center>

The yellow outlines include more grains than the fixed rank selection. Their membership
follows an area threshold rather than a chosen count.

Conditions may be combined. The next selection requires a perimeter above 6000 map units
and at least 600 measurements. The pixel-count condition excludes grains too small for
their outline to support a useful shape interpretation.

```python
condition = (grains.perimeter > 6000) & (grains.numPixel >= 600)

selectedGrains = grains[condition]
selectedGrains
```

```text
grain2d (y↑→x)
  size: 4
  Phase  Grains           Mineral     Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      4 (5248 pixels)  Forsterite  LightSkyBlue  mmm       Forsterite
  boundary segments: 736, inner: 0, triple points: 43
        Id   Phase  Pixels        meanRotation         GOS
        14       1    1448    (166°,127°,259°)      0.0135
        19       1    1208     (153°,68°,237°)     0.00808
        34       1    1047      (89°,99°,224°)     0.00769
        39       1    1545     (167°,81°,251°)       0.013
```

```python
plot(selectedGrains)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-16.png"></center>

Only the grains satisfying both conditions remain in the plot. Empty spaces belong to
grains excluded by at least one condition.

## By orientation

`findByOrientation` selects grains whose mean orientation lies within a specified angle
of a reference orientation. It accounts for crystal symmetry, so equivalent descriptions
of the same lattice orientation are treated as the same orientation.

We use the first gold grain from above as the reference and a threshold of 20 degrees.

```python
referenceGrain = mouseGrains[0]
similarGrains = grains.findByOrientation(referenceGrain.meanOrientation, 20 * degree)
similarGrains
```

```text
grain2d (y↑→x)
  size: 3
  Phase  Grains          Mineral     Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      3 (523 pixels)  Forsterite  LightSkyBlue  mmm       Forsterite
  boundary segments: 164, inner: 0, triple points: 13
        Id   Phase  Pixels        meanRotation         GOS
        25       1     181     (131°,64°,245°)     0.00698
        26       1     323     (131°,64°,250°)     0.00795
        58       1      19     (144°,74°,250°)      0.0104
```

```python
plot(ebsd['Fo'], ebsd['Fo'].orientations, ipfDirection=zvector)
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
plot(similarGrains.boundary, lineWidth=4, lineColor='gold')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-18.png"></center>

Three grains are selected, and two share a boundary. Neighbours with mean orientations
this close deserve a second look. The reconstruction may have split one grain, or the
grains may have belonged together before another process separated them.
[Merging Grains](GrainMerge_py.html) develops this question.

## List position and grain ID

A list position answers "which entry of this variable?" A grain ID answers "which
reconstructed grain?" They are initially often equal, but a subset keeps the original IDs
while its positions start again at zero.

```python
plot(grains)
largeGrains = grains[grains.numPixel > 50]
text(largeGrains, largeGrains.id)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-19.png"></center>

The labels are persistent grain IDs. They are not the positions of the labelled grains in
`largeGrains`.

```python
listPosition = 0
grainId = largeGrains.id[listPosition]
print(f'list position {listPosition} has grain ID {grainId}')

grainByPosition = largeGrains[listPosition]
grainById = largeGrains['id', grainId]
sameGrain = grainByPosition.id == grainById.id
sameGrain
```

```text
list position 0 has grain ID 1
array([ True])
```

`largeGrains[0]` selects by position. The form `largeGrains['id', grainId]` searches the
stored IDs. The printed logical value confirms that both expressions identify the same
grain here.

## From grains back to measurements

Every grain selection can be converted to the measurements it contains. This requires
the `grainId` property that `calcGrains` wrote into the map.

```python
measurementsByGrain = ebsd[grainById]
measurementsByGrain
```

```text
EBSD (y↑→x)
  size: 405
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral     Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      405 (100%)    Forsterite  LightSkyBlue  mmm       Forsterite
  properties    : bands, bc, bs, error, grainId, mad
  scan unit     : um
  X × Y         : [5000 → 5750] × [2000 → 3750]
  square lattice: spacing 50
```

```python
measurementsById = ebsd[ebsd.grainId == grainId]
sameMeasurements = np.array_equal(measurementsByGrain.id, measurementsById.id)
sameMeasurements
```

```text
True
```

The first command displays the selected measurements. The printed logical value confirms
that selecting by the grain object and matching the stored `ebsd.grainId` return the same
subset.

Applied to the largest grain, this relationship reveals the orientations measured inside
one reconstructed grain.

```python
largestGrain = grains[maxIndex]
largestGrainEbsd = ebsd[largestGrain]

plot(largestGrainEbsd, largestGrainEbsd.orientations, ipfDirection=zvector)
hold(True)
plot(largestGrain.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-23.png"></center>

The colours inside the black outline come from the individual measurements, not from one
grain mean. On this grain the spread is small, under two and a half degrees, so the fill
reads as a single shade and the unindexed white pixels are what stands out.

A spread this size has to be measured rather than looked for. The mean and spread of the
distribution are the subject of
[Grain Orientation Parameters](GrainOrientationParameters_py.html).

## Grains at the edge of the map

A grain touching the map edge continues outside the measured region. Its observed area
and shape describe only the measured piece. Remove such grains before calculating
per-grain size or shape statistics with `isBoundary`.

```python
interiorGrains = grains[~grains.isBoundary]
plot(interiorGrains)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-24.png"></center>

The white band around the plot is occupied by the omitted edge grains. This exclusion is
appropriate for comparing complete observed shapes. A standardised average grain-size
measurement may prescribe a different boundary-counting rule, so follow the selected
standard when reporting one.

The boundary network shows what `isBoundary` tests. Each grain boundary segment stores
the IDs of the two grains it separates. A segment at the map edge has no grain on one
side, so the corresponding ID is zero.

```python
# find segments with zero on one side
isOuterBoundary = np.any(grains.boundary.grainId == 0, axis=1)

plot(grains)
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary[isOuterBoundary], lineColor='red', lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-25.png"></center>

The red segments form the outer rim of the measured region. Their nonzero IDs identify
exactly the grains removed above.

```python
boundaryGrainId = grains.boundary[isOuterBoundary].grainId
boundaryGrainId = np.unique(boundaryGrainId[boundaryGrainId != 0])

plot(grains['id', boundaryGrainId])
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SelectingGrains-26.png"></center>

Only the edge grains remain. The explicit `'id'` lookup is required because the values
came from `grainBoundary.grainId` rather than from list positions.

## Next

[Shape Parameters](ShapeParameters_py.html) defines the area, perimeter, and other geometric
properties used to build selections. The ellipse, convex hull, and projection pages that
follow it provide further shape measures.
[Grain Orientation Parameters](GrainOrientationParameters_py.html) develops selections based
on the orientation distribution inside each grain.

Grain selections also lead back to the boundary network.
[Selecting Grain Boundaries](BoundarySelect_py.html) selects its segments, and
[Merging Grains](GrainMerge_py.html) uses selected boundaries to join grains.

## Technical details

List positions count from zero, as Python indexes, while grain ids count from one as
MATLAB's do. `selectInteractive` has no counterpart; a marker on the map is matplotlib's
`plt.plot` at the map coordinates, which are the screen coordinates under `y↑→x`.
