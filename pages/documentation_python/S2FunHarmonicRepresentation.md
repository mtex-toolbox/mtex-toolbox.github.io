<!--introduction-->

A spherical harmonic representation replaces a function by coefficients of standard
wave-like patterns on the sphere. This is the spherical counterpart of representing a
periodic signal by sines and cosines. Once the coefficients are known, MTEX can evaluate,
rotate, differentiate, and integrate the function efficiently.

The preceding [Sampling](S2FunSampling_py.html) page used a bandwidth to state how much
detail a discrete sample should preserve. Here we inspect that detail directly in an
`S2FunHarmonic`.

```python
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Construct a function from coefficients

MTEX stores harmonic coefficients degree by degree in the `fhat` property. Degree zero
contributes one coefficient. Degree one contributes the next three, ordered by harmonic
order $$-1$$, 0, and 1. The vector below therefore sets $$\hat f_0^0=1$$, $$\hat f_1^{-1}=0$$,
$$\hat f_1^0=3$$, and $$\hat f_1^1=0$$.

```python
fun = S2FunHarmonic([1, 0, 3, 0])
fun
```

```text
S2FunHarmonic
  bandwidth: 1
  mean     : 0.2821
```

```python
plot(fun)
mtexColorbar()
```

## Read the coefficient example

This function has maximum harmonic degree 1. Its degree-zero coefficient supplies a
constant part, while the nonzero degree-one coefficient makes the value change from one
pole to the other. The smooth, broad variation is characteristic of a low-bandwidth
function.

## What bandwidth controls

The *bandwidth*, also called the harmonic cut-off degree, is the largest degree retained
in the series. Smooth functions often need only a small bandwidth. Jumps, sharp edges, and
narrow features require higher degrees. If the bandwidth is too small, truncation can blur
those features and add oscillations around them.

The next figure starts from a degree-256 representation of the smiley. It then retains
degrees 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, and 8.

```python
sF = S2FunHarmonic(sqrt(abs(S2Fun.smiley(bandwidth=256))), bandwidth=256)

newMtexFigure(layout=[2, 3])
for bw in [256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8]:
  sF.bandwidth = bw
  nextAxis()
  pcolor(sF, upper=True, colorRange=[0, 0.75])
  mtexTitle(f'M = {bw}')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunHarmonicRepresentation-4.png"></center>

## Read the truncation sequence

At degrees 256 and 128, the eyes and mouth have crisp boundaries. At degrees 64 and 32,
the features broaden and oscillatory rings become visible. Degrees 16 and 8 no longer
preserve the shape of the smile. This sequence turns bandwidth into a practical choice:
lower it only until the feature or derived quantity of interest begins to change.

## Compute coefficients from a callable function

Coefficients need not be entered by hand. Suppose a rule can evaluate $$f(\mathbf{v})$$ at
arbitrary directions. A simple example is $$f(\mathbf{v})=(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{x})^3$$.
The ninth power below uses the same construction but exposes more nonzero harmonic
degrees.

```python
valueFunction = lambda v: dot(v, vector3d.X) ** 9
```

[S2FunHarmonic.quadrature](S2FunHarmonic.quadrature.html) evaluates this function on a
weighted spherical grid and computes its coefficients. Without an explicit `bandwidth`
option, it computes through the degree of the preference `maxS2Bandwidth`.

```python
S2F = S2FunHarmonic.quadrature(valueFunction)
S2F
```

```text
S2FunHarmonic
  bandwidth: 250
  mean     : -1.043e-17
```

---

```python
defaultBandwidth = S2F.bandwidth
defaultBandwidth
```

```text
250
```

---

```python
plot(S2F, upper=True)
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunHarmonicRepresentation-8.png"></center>

## Read the ninth-power function

The value is positive around specimen X and negative around the opposite direction. It
vanishes on the great circle perpendicular to X. Although the default representation
stores many degrees, this polynomial needs no degree above 9.

## Inspect the harmonic spectrum

[plotSpektra](S2FunHarmonic.plotSpektra.html) groups coefficients by degree. At degree
$$m$$, it plots $$\left(\sum_{k=-m}^{m}|\hat f_m^k|^2\right)^{1/2}$$.

```python
plotSpektra(S2F, figSize='small')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunHarmonicRepresentation-9.png"></center>

## Read the spectrum

Only odd degrees through 9 carry visible power. The earlier statement that almost all
coefficients were zero except for the very first one was too strong: the ninth power
contains contributions at degrees 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Coefficients beyond degree 9 are
numerical quadrature noise.

## Remove negligible degrees

[truncate](S2FunHarmonic.truncate.html) removes trailing degrees whose coefficients are
negligible relative to the spectrum. It does not refit the function. Here it reduces the
stored bandwidth to 9.

```python
S2F = S2F.truncate()
S2F
```

```text
S2FunHarmonic
  bandwidth: 9
  mean     : -1.043e-17
```

---

```python
truncatedBandwidth = S2F.bandwidth
truncatedBandwidth
```

```text
9
```

---

```python
plotSpektra(S2F, linewidth=2, figSize='small')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunHarmonicRepresentation-12.png"></center>

## Read the truncated spectrum

The same five nonzero odd degrees remain, while the empty high-degree tail has
disappeared. For coefficients estimated from discrete noisy data, deciding where signal
ends is a model choice rather than an exact polynomial test.
[Spherical Approximation and Interpolation](S2FunApproximationInterpolation_py.html) explains
how MTEX estimates such coefficients from scattered values.

## See the first ten basis functions

To conclude, the following command plots the first ten spherical harmonics. Each row of
the identity matrix selects one basis function.

```python
surf(S2FunHarmonic(np.eye(10)), layout=[2, 5], figSize='small')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/S2FunHarmonicRepresentation-13.png"></center>

Constant, dipolar, and progressively finer angular patterns appear as the coefficient
index increases. These basis patterns are what the preceding examples add together.

## The maths behind the representation

A function of bandwidth $$M$$ has the finite expansion

$$ f(\mathbf{v}) = \sum_{m=0}^{M}\sum_{l=-m}^{m}
\hat f_m^l Y_m^l(\mathbf{v}). $$

Here $$Y_m^l$$ is the spherical harmonic of degree $$m$$ and order $$l$$.
[Spherical Harmonics](SphericalHarmonics_py.html) defines these basis functions. MTEX uses an
orthonormal convention, so

$$ \|Y_m^l\|_2=1 $$

for every $$m$$ and $$l$$. Other normalizations occur in the literature, so coefficients from
another package must use the same convention before they are assigned to `fhat`. The
[Integration and norms](S2FunOperations_py.html) section defines the $$L^2$$ norm used here.
