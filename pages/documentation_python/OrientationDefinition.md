<!--introduction-->

An [orientation](orientation.orientation.html) answers one question: how is this crystal
placed in this specimen? In MTEX it is a [rotation](rotation.rotation.html) that maps
coordinates from the crystal reference frame into the specimen reference frame. It also
carries the symmetry attached to each frame.

This page assumes the three-dimensional directions introduced in
[Defining Three-Dimensional Vectors](VectorDefinition_py.html), the plane and direction
notation from [Miller Indices](CrystalDirections_py.html), and basic matrix algebra. The
constructors are the same as on [Defining Rotations](RotationDefinition_py.html), with a
[crystalFrame](crystalFrame.crystalFrame.html) supplied as an extra argument.

What this mapping means is developed in
[Theory](DefinitionAsCoordinateTransform_py.html) and compared with other conventions in
[MTEX vs. Bunge Convention](MTEXvsBungeConvention_py.html). This page concentrates on
building orientations.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

```python
# load the crystal symmetry and reference frame from a CIF file
cs = crystalFrame.load('Cu-Copper.cif')
```

## Euler Angles

Euler angles are the most common input and the one most easily misinterpreted. Their
axes, order, and mapping direction belong to the convention. Equal angle triplets in
different conventions need not describe the same orientation.

MTEX uses the Bunge convention by default. Naming it explicitly keeps a reusable script
independent of the current session preference. Angles are in radians, so values stated
in degrees are multiplied by `degree`.

```python
ori = orientation.byEuler(30 * degree, 50 * degree, 10 * degree, 'Bunge', cs)
ori
```

```text
orientation (Copper → y↑→x)
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1  Phi  phi2
    30   50    10
```

The display gives the three Bunge angles and names the copper crystal symmetry alongside
them. This attached crystal frame and symmetry are what distinguish an orientation from
a bare rotation.

## Rotation Matrix

A $$3 \times 3$$ matrix can define the same mapping. Its convention must be checked when
it comes from another program: this matrix maps crystal-frame coordinates into
specimen-frame coordinates.

```python
M = np.eye(3)
```

---

```python
ori = orientation.byMatrix(M, cs)
ori
```

```text
orientation (Copper → y↑→x)
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1  Phi  phi2
     0    0     0
```

The identity matrix gives the orientation in which the Cartesian crystal frame is
aligned with the specimen frame. It is the reference setting from which the Euler angles
of every other orientation are counted.

The point group does not by itself determine how the Cartesian crystal frame is
inscribed into the lattice axes. A statement such as X &#124;&#124; a*, Z &#124;&#124; c
belongs to the crystal reference frame, not to the symmetry. Changing that alignment
changes the coordinate description without moving the crystal; see
[The Crystal Reference System](CrystalReferenceSystem_py.html).

## Miller Indices

Metallurgy often names an orientation by two crystal quantities: the lattice plane
facing the specimen Z axis and the lattice direction pointing along specimen X. The
inputs must describe an orthogonal plane normal and direction. That is what
[orientation.byMiller](orientation.byMiller.html) takes, here for the Goss orientation
$$(011)[100]$$.

```python
ori = orientation.byMiller([0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], cs)
ori
```

```text
orientation (Copper → y↑→x)
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1  Phi  phi2
     0   45     0
```

Apply the orientation to the plane normal and the lattice direction to check where they
point in the specimen frame.

```python
rPlane = ori * Miller(0, 1, 1, cs, 'hkl')
rDirection = ori * Miller(1, 0, 0, cs, 'uvw')
```

```python
plot(cat(rPlane, rDirection), upper=True, grid=True, MarkerSize=10,
     label=['(011)', '[100]'], backgroundColor='w', noLabel=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/OrientationDefinition-10.png"></center>

Notice that the $$(011)$$ pole is at the centre, the specimen Z direction, while $$[100]$$
is on the specimen X axis at the rim.

Goss and the other named texture components are predefined. The vanishing angular
difference confirms that this result is also `orientation.goss(cs)`; see
[Standard Orientations](OrientationStandard_py.html).

```python
angle(ori, orientation.goss(cs)) / degree
```

```text
2.6852e-15
```

## Random Orientations

As for rotations, `rand` generates uniformly distributed orientations and needs the
crystal symmetry as well. MTEX stores the 100 results in one vectorized orientation
array.

```python
ori = orientation.rand(100, cs)
```

```python
len(ori)
```

```text
100
```

## Symmetrically Equivalent Orientations

A crystal cannot distinguish its symmetrically equivalent settings, so an orientation
represents a whole class of rotations. [symmetrise](orientation.symmetrise.html) lists
that class.

```python
ori = orientation.byEuler(30 * degree, 50 * degree, 10 * degree, 'Bunge', cs)
```

```python
len(ori.symmetrise())
```

```text
24
```

Copper has point group m-3m with 48 elements, 24 of them proper. Only those 24 describe
settings into which the crystal can be physically turned, and they are what `symmetrise`
lists: an orientation is a proper rotation, so the improper half of the point group
gives no further orientation.

The improper elements are lattice symmetries all the same, and they act wherever a
calculation compares directions rather than orientations - a plane normal and its
opposite are the same reflector under Friedel's law, which is why crystal directions
carry `antipodal`.

The equivalence of the 24 settings is why the angle between two orientations is the
smallest angle over all equivalent pairs. The dedicated
[Symmetry](OrientationSymmetry_py.html) page develops this rule and explains when to use
the `noSymmetry=True` option.

## Specimen Symmetry

A specimen may have symmetry of its own. A rolled sheet, for example, is commonly
modelled with orthorhombic symmetry: three mutually perpendicular twofold axes, or
equivalently three mirror planes in the full point group. It is represented by a
[specimenFrame](specimenFrame.specimenFrame.html) and passed alongside the crystal
symmetry.

```python
ss = specimenFrame('orthorhombic')
```

---

```python
ori = orientation.byEuler(30 * degree, 50 * degree, 10 * degree, 'Bunge', cs, ss)
ori
```

```text
orientation (Copper → y↑→x)
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1  Phi  phi2
    30   50    10
```

Crystal symmetry acts in the crystal frame and specimen symmetry in the specimen frame,
so the class is the product of the two. It holds the 24 proper copper elements times the
4 proper orthorhombic ones.

```python
len(ori.symmetrise())
```

```text
96
```

Specimen symmetry is a statement about the sample, not about the measurement. Its axes
must match the physical specimen frame, and imposing a symmetry that is not present
hides real texture components. [Specimen Symmetry](SpecimenSymmetry_py.html) explains when
to use it.

## Technical Details

`symmetrise` lists the proper equivalents only, `ori.CS.numProper() * ori.SS.numProper()`
of them, where MTEX in MATLAB lists all `numSym() * numSym()` products of the full point
groups and offers a `'proper'` option to cut them back. An orientation here is a proper
rotation by construction, so the two halves of a Laue group would give each equivalent
twice; the improper elements live on the frame and enter through `antipodal` on the
directions instead.

[Theory](DefinitionAsCoordinateTransform_py.html) explains how an orientation maps
coordinates, which is the definition the rest of MTEX rests on.
[Pole Figures](OrientationPoleFigure_py.html) and
[Inverse Pole Figures](OrientationInversePoleFigure_py.html) are the two ways of looking at
one. Existing orientation files are handled by [Import](OrientationImport_py.html).
