<!--introduction-->

A [vector3d](vector3d.vector3d.html) stores one or more vectors through their Cartesian
components $$x$$, $$y$$ and $$z$$. A reference frame identifies the coordinate system in which
data are expressed. It includes an identity, basis and default plotting convention. The
components are coordinates in that frame.

A vector also has a length. When only its direction matters, dividing out that length
gives a point on the unit sphere. This spherical view underlies specimen directions, pole
figures and crystal directions throughout MTEX. Crystal directions add lattice
information and are introduced in [Miller Indices](CrystalDirections_py.html).

This page assumes basic NumPy arrays and indexing. See
[Lists and Indexing](ListsAndIndexing_py.html) if those are new to you.

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Cartesian Coordinates

Define a vector directly from its three Cartesian components.

```python
v = vector3d(1, 2, 3)
v
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  x  y  z
  1  2  3
```

The summary reports one vector and lists its $$x$$, $$y$$ and $$z$$ components. A spherical
plot uses its direction and therefore divides out its length.

```python
plot(v, grid=True, upper=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/VectorDefinition-4.png"></center>

The point lies in the upper-right quadrant because $$x$$ and $$y$$ are positive. It lies
inside the rim because $$z$$ is positive. Multiplying all three components by the same
positive number would not move this point. [Spherical Projections](SphericalProjections_py.html)
explains how the sphere is mapped onto the page.

The [norm](vector3d.norm.html) is the stored vector's length.

```python
norm(v)
```

```text
3.7417
```

For $$(1,2,3)$$ the result is $$\sqrt{14}$$, displayed here as 3.7417.
[normalize](vector3d.normalize.html) divides each component by that length, so the
result has length one without changing direction.

```python
norm(normalize(v))
```

```text
1
```

A zero vector has no direction, so its normalized components are undefined.

```python
normalize(vector3d(0, 0, 0))
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
    x    y    z
  NaN  NaN  NaN
```

The output contains three `NaN` values. Check for zero length before normalizing measured
data.

Individual coordinates can be read and changed as properties.

```python
v.x
```

```text
1
```

---

```python
v.x = 0
v
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  x  y  z
  0  2  3
```

The displayed row is now $$(0,2,3)$$. Changing a component preserves neither the previous
length nor the previous direction.

## Polar Coordinates

A direction can also be described by two angles. The *polar angle* $$\theta$$ is measured
away from the Z axis. The *azimuth angle* $$\rho$$ is measured in the XY plane away from
the X axis. [vector3d.byPolar](vector3d.byPolar.html) takes the angles in that order and
returns a unit vector.

```python
v = vector3d.byPolar(60 * degree, 45 * degree)
v
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
      x      y    z
  0.612  0.612  0.5
```

MTEX stores angles in radians. Multiplying by `degree` converts a value in degrees to
radians for input.

```python
plot(v, grid=True, upper=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/VectorDefinition-11.png"></center>

The point is $$60^\circ$$ from Z and turns $$45^\circ$$ from X towards Y. Thus $$\theta$$
controls its distance from the centre of this spherical plot, while $$\rho$$ controls the
direction around the centre.

The angle properties read back in radians. Divide by `degree` to display them in degrees.

```python
v.rho / degree  # azimuth angle in degrees
```

```text
45.0000
```

---

```python
v.theta / degree  # polar angle in degrees
```

```text
60.0000
```

## Basis Directions and Reference Frames

The constants `vector3d.X`, `vector3d.Y` and `vector3d.Z` spell the three Cartesian basis
directions. They make combinations easier to read.

```python
v = vector3d.X + 2 * vector3d.Y
v
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  x  y  z
  1  2  0
```

The summary shows the components $$(1,2,0)$$. Fresh `vector3d` data are frame-free. They
are not tied to a named measurement, rolling or geological frame. At plotting time they
follow the session's default specimen frame. [Axes Alignment](AxesAlignment_py.html)
explains named frames and their plotting conventions.

## Many Directions at Once

One `vector3d` variable can hold a whole array of vectors. MTEX operations act on the
array at once, so loops over individual vectors are usually unnecessary. Passing
coordinate arrays creates one vector per entry.

```python
v = vector3d([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0, 1)
v
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  size: 5
  x  y  z
  1  0  1
  2  0  1
  3  0  1
  4  0  1
  5  0  1
```

The displayed summary contains five rows. The array has a shape and uses the same
indexing rules as a NumPy array, so the first entry is `v[0]`.

```python
v.shape
```

```text
(5,)
```

---

```python
v[1]
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  x  y  z
  2  0  1
```

The second row, $$(2,0,1)$$, is returned as another `vector3d` object. When coordinates are
already arranged in a matrix, `vector3d.byXYZ` reads one vector from each row.

```python
xyz = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
v = vector3d.byXYZ(xyz)
v
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  size: 3
  x  y  z
  1  0  0
  0  1  0
  1  1  1
```

The three output rows match the three matrix rows. Prefer `byXYZ` when the row convention
matters. The constructor also accepts coordinate matrices and reads them by rows as well,
one vector per row of three components.

[vector3d.rand](vector3d.rand.html) creates uniformly distributed random unit
directions. The following call creates 100 directions. Its long object summary is not
useful here, so the assignment keeps it out of the page.

```python
v = vector3d.rand(100)
```

```python
plot(v, upper=True, grid=True, markerSize=4)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/VectorDefinition-20.png"></center>

The plot handles the complete array in one call. Only directions on the upper hemisphere
appear because of `upper`; the option does not identify a direction with its negative.

## Plotting Conventions

A [plotting convention](plottingConvention.html) states how a reference frame is laid
out on screen. It does not change the vector or re-express it in another frame. Pass
`how2plot` to change one plot.

```python
v = vector3d(1, 2, 3)
```

```python
plot(v, how2plot='z←↑y', grid=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/VectorDefinition-22.png"></center>

The axis annotation now shows Z pointing left and Y pointing up. The components and
length of `v` have not changed. To align subsequent plots, use the explicit string form
of `plottingConvention.default` shown at the start of this page.
[Axes Alignment](AxesAlignment_py.html) develops frame changes and plotting conventions in
full.

## Directions and Axes

A direction distinguishes its two ends, so `v` and `-v` point in different directions.
An axis treats those two signs as equivalent. The `upper` option only selects a
hemisphere. It does not turn a direction into an axis.
[Axes and Antipodal Symmetry](VectorsAxes_py.html) explains how the `antipodal` flag
changes angles, means and densities.
