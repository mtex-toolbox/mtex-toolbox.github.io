<!--introduction-->

```python
from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

[Crystal symmetry](CrystalSymmetries_py.html) describes operations that leave a crystal
lattice unchanged. *Specimen symmetry* describes operations that leave the texture of a
specimen unchanged. The forming process is often the physical reason for this
invariance.

Rolling, for example, is commonly modelled by orthorhombic specimen symmetry. A texture
with this symmetry is unchanged by $$180^\circ$$ rotations about the rolling direction
(RD), transverse direction (TD), and normal direction (ND).

This is a model of the texture, not a consequence of the specimen having a rectangular
shape. A shear texture, a through-thickness gradient, or a misaligned specimen may not
have that symmetry. Imposing symmetry that is absent averages distinct components
together and hides real information.

An orientation maps coordinates from the crystal frame into the specimen frame. Specimen
symmetry therefore acts from the left, while crystal symmetry acts from the right. See
[Symmetrically Equivalent Orientations](OrientationSymmetry_py.html).

## Defining a Specimen Symmetry

A `specimenFrame` is defined by its point group. Only a small number of point groups
occur in practice. The trivial group is the default when no specimen symmetry is
specified.

```python
ss = specimenFrame('1')
ss
```

```text
specimenFrame (specimen, y↑→x)
```

Orthorhombic specimen symmetry is the common choice for rolled material. It may be
specified by its point group `'mmm'` or by the name `'orthorhombic'`.

```python
ss = specimenFrame('mmm')
ss
```

```text
specimenFrame (specimen, y↑→x)
  symmetry: mmm
  elements: 8
```

The full point group `mmm` has eight operations. Its proper subgroup has four rotations:
the identity and one $$180^\circ$$ rotation about each specimen axis. Orientations live in
the rotation group, so these proper operations are the ones that identify equivalent
orientations.

```python
numberOfOperations = numSym(ss)
numberOfProperRotations = numProper(ss)
numberOfOperations, numberOfProperRotations
```

```text
(8, 4)
```

Note the difference between `'1'` and `'triclinic'`. The first denotes the identity
alone. The lattice-type name `'triclinic'` selects the point group $$\bar 1$$, which also
contains inversion.

```python
numberInIdentityGroup = numSym(specimenFrame('1'))
numberInTriclinicGroup = numSym(specimenFrame('triclinic'))
numberInIdentityGroup, numberInTriclinicGroup
```

```text
(1, 2)
```

## The Effect on an ODF

An [orientation distribution function](ODFAnalysis.html) (ODF) is a density over
orientations. We begin with one smooth component and trivial specimen symmetry.

```python
cs = crystalFrame.load('quartz.cif')
odf = unimodalODF(orientation.byEuler(30 * degree, 50 * degree, 10 * degree, cs), halfwidth=15 * degree)
```

The `complete` and `upper` flags keep the full upper hemisphere visible. This matters for
the comparison below, because a plot with nontrivial specimen symmetry otherwise defaults
to its specimen fundamental sector.

```python
plotPDF(odf, Miller(1, 0, -1, 0, cs), contourf=True, complete=True, upper=True)
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SpecimenSymmetry-7.png"></center>

The peaks are equivalent crystal poles. Notice that their pattern is not forced to be
symmetric about both horizontal and vertical specimen axes.

The texture index is the squared [norm](SO3Fun.norm.html) of the ODF. The first value is
the baseline before specimen symmetry is imposed.

```python
textureIndexTrivial = norm(odf) ** 2
textureIndexTrivial
```

```text
27.8852
```

Assigning orthorhombic specimen symmetry makes the ODF invariant under its proper
rotations. This changes the represented function rather than merely changing its plot.

```python
odf.SS = specimenFrame('mmm')
```

---

```python
plotPDF(odf, Miller(1, 0, -1, 0, cs), contourf=True, complete=True, upper=True)
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/SpecimenSymmetry-10.png"></center>

The second pole figure is symmetric about the horizontal and vertical specimen axes. The
density is shared among the equivalent positions, so the peaks are lower than in the
first plot.

```python
textureIndexOrthorhombic = norm(odf) ** 2
textureIndexOrthorhombic
```

```text
7.2683
```

The second texture index is also smaller. Quantities derived from the ODF therefore
change when specimen symmetry is imposed.

## Specimen Symmetry and the Specimen Frame

A [reference frame](referenceFrame.referenceFrame.html) is the coordinate system in which
data are expressed. A symmetry is the point group under which those data are invariant.
The two are attached, but they are not the same concept.

Which physical direction a symmetry axis denotes depends on the specimen frame. The point
group `'112'` has its twofold rotation about the $$z$$ axis.

```python
ss = specimenFrame('112')
ss
```

```text
specimenFrame (specimen, y↑→x)
  symmetry: 112
  elements: 2
```

The rolling frame names its axes RD, TD, and ND and supplies their plotting convention.
Asking it for the same point group therefore declares that the twofold $$z$$ axis is ND,
and those names appear in summaries and plots.

```python
ss = specimenFrame.rolling('112')
ss
```

```text
specimenFrame (rolling, TD←RD↑)
  symmetry: 112
  elements: 2
```

Assigning a frame does not rotate an ODF or correct a mounting error. Use
[Sample Symmetry](DetectionOfSampleSymmetry_py.html) to test and align a measured texture
before imposing a nontrivial symmetry.
