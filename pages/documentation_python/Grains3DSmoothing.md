<!--introduction-->

Grains reconstructed from voxel data have a boundary that follows the voxel faces. Every
face normal points along one of the three axes, so a boundary normal distribution or a
curvature computed from it measures the grid, not the specimen. This page coarsens the
voxel surface, smooths it, and measures the price in grain volume. The aim is a surface
suitable for quantitative analysis, not simply a smoother-looking picture.

```python

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
how2plot = plottingConvention.default3D

ebsd = EBSD3.load(fname)
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=5 * degree)
print(grains)
```

```

## The boundary network is stratified

A boundary face separates two grains. Along a triple line three grains meet, at a
quadruple point four. `nodeType` counts the grains at every vertex and adds 10 on the
outer hull of the measured volume, where a vertex inside a single grain also occurs.
These are counts of mesh vertices, so they depend on resolution; they are not counts of
complete triple lines or physical quadruple points.

```python
t = grains.boundary.nodeType()
n = np.bincount(t[t > 0])
print(np.column_stack([np.flatnonzero(n), n[n > 0]]))
```

```text
[[     2 241422]
 [     3  41328]
 [     4   3806]
 [     5    167]
 [     6      4]

 [    12  11912]
 [    13   1078]
 [    14     27]]
```

A junction must not be averaged with the interior of a face, which is why the smoothing
below treats each stratum in turn.

## Coarsen first

`reduceBoundary` merges the vertices of each cell of twice the voxel size into one.
Clustering distinguishes the grains meeting at a vertex and the faces of the hull,
preserving their junction structure where the coarsened mesh remains resolved. The
centroid of a cluster already averages the voxel steps; the flag `quadric=True` puts the
vertex where the faces around it are best approximated instead, which keeps flat
boundaries flat.

```python
grainsC = reduceBoundary(grains, 2, quadric=True)
print(grainsC)
```

```text
grain3d (y↑→x)
  Phase  Grains              Mineral  Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      812 (volume 15625)  unknown  LightSkyBlue  432       unknown
  boundary faces: 289348
```

Check how many faces remain and whether very small grains have lost their enclosing
surface. Coarsening can collapse a grain below its cell size; this matters when the
fine-grain population is part of the question.

```python
print([len(grains.boundary), len(grainsC.boundary)])
print(np.count_nonzero(grainsC.volume <= 0))
```

```text
[757562, 289348]

```

The largest grain makes the geometric change easy to see.

```python
id = int(np.argmax(grains.volume))
plot(grains[id], micronbar='off', edgeAlpha=0.2)
setCamera(how2plot)
```

```python

setCamera(how2plot)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><a href="figures/python/Grains3DSmoothing-8.html"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grains3DSmoothing-8.png"></a></center>

## Smooth

`smoothBoundary` moves the vertices and nothing else. Quadruple points and the hull stay
fixed, every triple line is smoothed as a curve between its quadruple points, and every
boundary face as a surface between its triple lines. The filters are the ones of the
two-dimensional [grain smoothing](GrainSmoothing_py.html): `laplaceFilter` shrinks each grain
a little per iteration, `taubinFilter` keeps the volumes approximately, `curvatureFilter`
solves for a smoothing length in one step.

```python
grainsS = smoothBoundary(grainsC, taubinFilter(20))
newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 3], figSize='large')
plot(grains[id], micronbar='off', edgeAlpha=0.2)
setCamera(how2plot)
mtexTitle('Voxel surface')
nextAxis()
plot(grainsC[id], micronbar='off', edgeAlpha=0.2)
setCamera(how2plot)
mtexTitle('Coarsened')
nextAxis()
plot(grainsS[id], micronbar='off', edgeAlpha=0.2)
setCamera(how2plot)
mtexTitle('Taubin smoothed')
```

Triple lines remain shared by the same grains, but their vertices may move. Add
`fixTripleLines=True` to hold them fixed during smoothing. Keeping the outer hull fixed
conserves the enclosed total volume for a valid mesh; it does not conserve each grain's
volume.

Compare Laplace and Taubin smoothing from the same coarsened mesh. Include the coarsened
result separately so its contribution is visible.

```python
grainsL = smoothBoundary(grainsC, laplaceFilter(20))
vol = np.column_stack([grains.volume, grainsC.volume, grainsL.volume, grainsS.volume])
print(vol.sum(axis=0))
```

```text
[15625. 15625. 15625. 15625.]
```

Relative volume change reveals whether the surface treatment affects the fine grains more
strongly. The three columns below correspond to coarsening, coarsening plus Laplace, and
coarsening plus Taubin.

```python
relativeChange = 100 * (vol[:, 1:] - vol[:, :1]) / vol[:, :1]
print(np.median(np.abs(relativeChange), axis=0))

plt.figure()
plt.scatter(vol[:, 0], relativeChange[:, 1], 12, label='Laplace')
plt.scatter(vol[:, 0], relativeChange[:, 2], 12, label='Taubin')
plt.axhline(0, color='k', linestyle='--')
plt.xscale('log')
plt.xlabel('original grain volume (length units$^3$)')
plt.ylabel('volume change (%)')
plt.legend(loc='best')
```

```text
[ 0.6447 11.961   3.3128]
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grains3DSmoothing-11.png"></center>

The option `maxDisplacement` limits each coordinate change relative to the mesh entering
the smoothing step. It does not undo displacement or a collapsed grain from coarsening.
For example, half the smallest voxel spacing gives a bound tied to measurement
resolution:

    grainsBounded = smoothBoundary(grainsC, taubinFilter(20),
                                   maxDisplacement=0.5 * min(ebsd.dx, ebsd.dy, ebsd.dz))

The scheme `scheme='coupled'` smooths all movable vertices together instead of treating
triple lines before face interiors. Compare its geometric effect if junction positions
are central to the analysis.

## What the smoothing changes downstream

The boundary normal distribution of the voxel surface has all its weight on the three
axes. After smoothing the normals spread over the sphere.

```python
gB = grains.boundary
gB = gB[np.all(gB.grainId > 0, axis=1)]
plot(calcGBND(gB), 'upper')
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grains3DSmoothing-12.png"></center>

```python
gBS = grainsS.boundary
gBS = gBS[np.all(gBS.grainId > 0, axis=1)]
plot(calcGBND(gBS), 'upper')
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Grains3DSmoothing-13.png"></center>

## Refine

`refineBoundary` splits every edge at its midpoint and every face into four. No vertex
moves, so volumes, areas and the grains a face separates are inherited exactly.
Refinement increases mesh density, for instance before a filter with a short smoothing
length. It adds no measurement information and cannot recover a feature removed by
coarsening.

```python
grainsR = refineBoundary(grainsS)
print([len(grainsS.boundary), len(grainsR.boundary)])
```

```text
[289348, 1157392]
```

## Choose the treatment for the quantity being measured

Volume, area and normal distributions need different levels of geometric fidelity. The
area change below complements the volume comparison: a small change in volume can
accompany a large decrease in staircase area.

```python
surfaceArea = np.array([grains.surface().sum(), grainsC.surface().sum(), grainsL.surface().sum(), grainsS.surface().sum()])
print(100 * (surfaceArea / surfaceArea[0] - 1))
```

```text
[  0.     -15.0252 -32.9219 -31.0261]
```

Here the sum counts shared interfaces twice, consistently for all four meshes. For a
physical internal area per volume, count each interface once as on the
[Boundary Network](Grains3DBoundaries_py.html) page. Repeat the comparison with a smaller
coarsening factor or fewer filter iterations: a conclusion about morphology should survive
reasonable choices near the voxel resolution. A smooth mesh alone does not establish a
resolved curvature or remove uncertainty from missing orientations.

## Next

Continue with [Boundary Network](Grains3DBoundaries_py.html) to measure interface area and
inspect junctions. [Properties](Grains3DProperties_py.html) measures the enclosed grains,
and [Boundary Normal Distribution](BoundaryNormalDistribution_py.html) develops the analysis
of their surface normals.

## Technical details

MATLAB's flags `'quadric'`, `'fixTripleLines'`, `'coupled'` are the keywords
`quadric=True`, `fixTripleLines=True`, `scheme='coupled'`; `nodeType` is a method of the
boundary, and the largest grain's position counts from 0.
