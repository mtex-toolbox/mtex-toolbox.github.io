<!--introduction-->

A cluster is a group of observations that lie close together in the space of the data.
Clustering assigns each observation to a group without requiring the groups to be named in
advance.

MTEX can cluster directions and orientations while respecting their geometry and symmetry.
This is different from [density estimation](DensityEstimation_py.html), which constructs a
continuous density from discrete observations. Here the result is one integer label per
observation and one representative center per cluster.

## Cluster directional data

We start with directions sampled from a squared smiley function. Squaring the function
concentrates the sample around its eyes and mouth while retaining points between those
features.

```python
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
S2F = S2Fun.smiley() ** 2
v = discreteSample(S2F, 10000, rng=rng)

scatter(v, MarkerAlpha=0.2, MarkerSize=2)
```

## Read the cluster result

For directions, [calcCluster](vector3d.calcCluster.html) uses CLASSIX by default. The array
`cInd` has one integer cluster label for every input direction, counted from zero. The
entries of `center` are the corresponding mean directions.

Cluster labels are identifiers, not ranks: cluster 0 is not intrinsically more important
than cluster 1. We use the labels only to assign colors, `ind2color` counting from one, and
then mark each returned center.

```python
cInd, center = calcCluster(v)

plot(v, ind2color(cInd + 1), MarkerAlpha=0.2, MarkerSize=2)
annotate(center)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/ClusterDemo-2.png"></center>

## Tune the grouping

The colored regions follow the separated strokes of the smiley, while the centers sit inside
the densest parts of those regions. CLASSIX first forms local groups and then merges nearby
groups into clusters.

Two options control how readily this happens. Increasing `radius` makes the local groups
coarser and usually produces fewer clusters. The `minPoints` option sets the size below
which tiny groups are merged into neighboring clusters. If the automatic result is too
fragmented, increase `radius`; if isolated specks survive, increase `minPoints`. The port
estimates the radius itself, from the distances to the tenth nearest neighbours, so no
further package is needed.

## Respect antipodal symmetry

Antipodal directions identify a direction `v` with its opposite `-v`. Setting the
`antipodal` property tells MTEX to measure proximity with this equivalence in mind.

The smiley sample on its own cannot show this. No feature of it lies opposite another, so
identifying `v` with `-v` has nothing to merge. Add the opposite of every sampled direction,
and each feature gains one.

```python
vSym = cat(v, -v)

cInd, center = calcCluster(vSym)

plot(vSym, ind2color(cInd + 1))
annotate(center)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/ClusterDemo-3.png"></center>

The two discs are the upper and the lower hemisphere. Read as ordinary directions, the
sample falls into eight clusters. Every feature of the smiley and every one of their
opposites carries a color of its own.

```python
vSym.antipodal = True
cInd, center = calcCluster(vSym)

plot(vSym, ind2color(cInd + 1), MarkerAlpha=0.2, MarkerSize=2)
annotate(center)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/ClusterDemo-4.png"></center>

One disc is left, and four clusters, each exactly twice the size of before. Every feature
has been merged with the one opposite it. The two eyes stay apart, because one eye is not
the opposite of the other.

The blue cluster reaches the rim of the disc at the top and at the bottom. Those are
opposite directions, and they now share a label. This is a change in the meaning of a
direction, not merely a change in how the same labels are drawn.

## Build an orientation example

The same idea applies in orientation space. We construct an orientation distribution
function (ODF) with a broad fibre component and a compact unimodal component.
[Kernel selection](OptimalKernel_py.html) explains how the halfwidth controls smoothing when an
ODF is estimated from observations.

```python
cs = crystalFrame('432')
odf = (0.7 * fibreODF(fibre.gamma(cs), halfwidth=10 * degree)
       + 0.3 * unimodalODF(orientation.byEuler(30 * degree, 10 * degree, 60 * degree, cs)))

ori = discreteSample(odf, 10000, rng=rng)
```

## Compare the model with its sample

Filled contours show sections through the model ODF. The points are the sampled
orientations drawn over every section.

```python
plotSection(odf, contourf=True)
mtexColorMap('white2black')
plot(ori, add2all=True, MarkerSize=3, MarkerAlpha=0.25, all=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/ClusterDemo-6.png"></center>

Notice the narrow concentration of points around the compact peak and the elongated
concentration along the fibre. These are the two structures the clustering step should
distinguish.

## Cluster the orientations

Orientation clustering does not use CLASSIX unless it is selected explicitly. The embedding
used by this method accounts for crystal symmetry, so symmetrically equivalent
representations of an orientation receive the same cluster label. The call supplies the
radius and the minimum cluster size, as the text above says of this example.

```python
cId, center = calcCluster(ori, method='classix', radius=0.1, minPoints=100)

plotSection(ori, ind2color(cId + 1), MarkerSize=3, MarkerAlpha=0.25, all=True)
annotate(center)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/ClusterDemo-7.png"></center>

The dominant color follows the fibre and another color collects the compact unimodal
portion. The annotated centers summarize the returned groups; they do not replace the full
within-cluster spread visible here.
