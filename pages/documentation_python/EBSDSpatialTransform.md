<!--introduction-->

A spatial transform maps positions in one coordinate system to positions in another. It
can describe the distortion between an EBSD map and an SEM image, stage drift during a
scan, or the foreshortening of a tilted surface.

This is different from a *reference frame*, the coordinate system in which specimen or
crystal data are expressed. A spatial transform moves map positions but does not correct
the orientations stored at those positions. Use
[Reference Frame Alignment](EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) when the map coordinates and Euler
angles do not refer to the same specimen frame.

A function can move positions too. A [spatialTransform](spatialTransform.html) also
composes, inverts, displays itself, fits measured point pairs, and can be stored for
another data set. [Maps and Images](EBSDMapsAndImages_py.html) explains how two images first
come to share a specimen coordinate system and array layout.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('twins')
```

## Direction Is the Contract

One rule fixes everything else: `T` maps a position in coordinate system A to the
position of the same physical point in coordinate system B.

The product `T2 * T1` reads in matrix order, so `T1` is applied first. Filling a regular
output grid uses `inv(T)` rather than `T`. For each target pixel, the resampler has to ask
where it came from, not where it goes.

Spatial transforms are two dimensional. They act on $$x$$ and $$y$$ and leave $$z$$ unchanged.

```python
T = spatialTransformRigid(vector3d(5, -2, 0))
T
```

```text
spatialTransformRigid
  model  stage  parameters
  rigid  ·      move (5, -2)
```

Apply a transform to positions with `*`, or call `eval` explicitly.

```python
pos = ebsd.pos[0, 0:3]
posMoved = T * pos

np.column_stack([pos.x.ravel(), posMoved.x.ravel()])
```

```text
array([[0. , 5. ],
       [0.3, 5.3],
       [0.6, 5.6]])
```

## Choose the Smallest Model That Describes the Distortion

Each class represents a different amount and pattern of spatial freedom. The names are
historical, so read their meanings rather than guessing from them:

* [spatialTransformId](spatialTransformId.html) means that nothing separates the two
  coordinate systems.
* [spatialTransformRigid](spatialTransformRigid.html) is one translation, the same
  everywhere. It does not include a rotation.
* [spatialTransformShift](spatialTransformShift.html) is a full 2D affine map:
  translation, rotation, scale, and shear in one homogeneous matrix.
* [spatialTransformProjective](spatialTransformProjective.html) is a homography. It keeps
  lines straight, but parallel lines need not remain parallel, as in a perspective view
  of a tilted plane.
* [spatialTransformTilt](spatialTransformTilt.html) is the staged model used to recover
  specimen tilt from repeatedly correlated image pairs.
* [spatialTransformPoly](spatialTransformPoly.html) describes a displacement that varies
  polynomially across the coordinate system.
* [spatialTransformDrift](spatialTransformDrift.html) varies only along the slow scan
  direction. It models rolling-shutter-like scan drift rather than an arbitrary smooth
  field.
* [spatialTransformField](spatialTransformField.html) stores measured displacements and
  interpolates between their positions without imposing a parametric model.
* [spatialTransformHandle](spatialTransformHandle.html) wraps a function when none of the
  fitted models applies.

Start with the least flexible model that has a physical reason to be present. A flexible
model can follow noise and may extrapolate badly beyond the point pairs. Correspondences
should span the area that will be transformed, and residuals should also be checked at
withheld landmarks.

Differently modelled hops can be stored in one list. Such a list is an ordered sequence
of hops, not a set of alternatives. It is primarily a container: combine the required
hops or process them one at a time before calling methods such as `inv` on them.

```python
hops = [spatialTransformRigid(vector3d(1, 0, 0)), spatialTransformPoly(np.zeros((3, 2)), 1)]
for hop in hops:
  print(hop)
```

```text
spatialTransformRigid
  model  stage  parameters
  rigid  ·      move (1, 0)
spatialTransformPoly
  model   stage  parameters
  poly11  ·      |c| = 0
```

## Fit a Transform From Two Point Sets

A transform is usually measured rather than written down. Locate the same features in
both coordinate systems, then ask the chosen class for the member of its family that maps
the first set onto the second. The two sets must use the same length unit and point
order.

The geometric minimum is not enough for a reliable fit. An affine needs at least three
non-collinear pairs, a homography at least four well-spread pairs, and a degree-two
polynomial at least six. More pairs let a fit expose noise and mismatches.

For an example with a known answer, apply a projective distortion to map positions and
fit the homography back from the resulting pairs.

```python
T0 = spatialTransformProjective([[1, 0.02, 3], [-0.01, 1.05, -2], [1e-4, 2e-4, 1]])

posA = ebsd.pos.flatten()[::50]
posB = T0 * posA

T = spatialTransformProjective.fit(posA, posB)
T
```

```text
spatialTransformProjective
  model       stage  parameters
  projective  ·      perspective (0.0001, 0.0002)
```

The maximum error is at rounding level.

```python
np.max(norm(T * posA - posB))
```

```text
2.5619e-14
```

Real correspondences are not this clean. Projective and polynomial fits use Tukey
bisquare reweighting, so points that disagree with the consensus lose influence. Here
every tenth target point is moved somewhere else.

```python
posBad = posB.copy()
posBad[::10] = posBad[::10] + vector3d(30, -40, 0)

TBad = spatialTransformProjective.fit(posA, posBad)

np.max(norm(TBad * posA - posB))
```

```text
7.1409e-14
```

The homography is fitted after both point sets are centred and scaled to a common spread,
Hartley's normalisation. Without it the algebraic residual of the fit weighs a point by
its distance from the origin, and which tenth of the points is spoiled then decides
whether the reweighting finds the transform.

Other classes match their physical model: a rigid fit takes a weighted mean
displacement, an affine uses weighted least squares, drift uses a median displacement per
scan line, and a field keeps the samples exactly.

Where a confidence per pair is available, pass it with `weights=` instead of asking the
fit to infer every bad match. Cross-correlation supplies such weights.

## Declare a Model With + and Compose Fitted Transforms With *

There are two ways to put transforms together, and they are not the same operation.

`*` composes fitted transforms and simplifies where it can. It decides by value, so an
operand that reports `isid` disappears. An unfitted prototype has zero coefficients and
therefore reports itself as the identity. In the product below, the shift silently
disappears and only the drift remains.

```python
spatialTransformShift() * spatialTransformDrift()
```

```text
spatialTransformDrift
  model  stage  parameters
  drift  ·      (no knots)
```

`+` declares a model. It reads left to right in the order the stages are applied and
keeps both. Only a literal `spatialTransformId` is dropped, because that class means that
nothing separates the two coordinate systems.

```python
spatialTransformShift() + spatialTransformDrift()
```

```text
spatialTransformComposite
  model        stage  parameters
  shift-drift  shift  scale 1 × 1, rotate 0°, shear 0°, move (0, 0)
               drift  (no knots)
```

Use `+` for a distortion model that is about to be fitted, and `*` for transforms whose
coefficients are already known. Here `+` chains maps; it does not add displacements as
`+` on a [vector3d](vector3d.vector3d.html) would.

Both operations flatten composites rather than nesting them, and their application order
is consistent.

```python
R = spatialTransformRigid(vector3d(1, -2, 0))
S = spatialTransformShift([[1, 0.1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])

np.max(norm((R + S) * posA - S * (R * posA)))
```

```text
0
```

## Inverting

Rigid, affine, projective, and degree-one polynomial transforms have exact inverses. Their
`inv` returns another closed-form transform.

```python
inv(T)
```

```text
spatialTransformProjective
  model       stage  parameters
  projective  ·      perspective (-0.000102, -0.000189)
```

A degree-two polynomial, drift spline, or scattered field has no general closed-form
inverse. Its inverse is a [spatialTransformInverse](spatialTransformInverse.html), which
solves for each source position iteratively.

```python
P = spatialTransformPoly.fit(posA, posB, degree=2)

Pinv = inv(P)
Pinv
```

```text
spatialTransformInverse
  model       stage  parameters
  inv-poly22  ·      |c| = 3.606
```

The round trip returns the sampled positions to rounding level.

```python
np.max(norm(Pinv.eval(P * posA) - posA))
```

```text
6.5249e-11
```

Iteration converges while the displacement gradient remains below one in the queried
region. A field that folds has no unique inverse. Asking far outside the region used for
fitting can also fail, and the inverse reports either failure rather than returning a
wrong position.

## Collapse a Chain at Chosen Positions

Evaluating every stage repeatedly is wasted work when the chain will be applied to many
pixels. [discretize](spatialTransform.html) samples a chain at chosen positions and
returns one [spatialTransformField](spatialTransformField.html).

```python
F = discretize(R + S, posA)
F
```

```text
spatialTransformField
  model  stage  parameters
  field  ·      458 points, |u| <= 5.274
```

The field agrees with the chain at the sample positions. Between them it interpolates
linearly over the triangulation of the samples, and beyond them it takes the nearest
sample, so the sampling density controls fidelity.

```python
np.max(norm(F * posA - (R + S) * posA))
```

```text
8.8818e-16
```

## Apply a Transform to an EBSD Map

[transform](EBSD.transform.html) moves every pixel and carries its unit cell with it.
Orientations, phase labels, and all per-pixel properties remain untouched. A spatial
transform therefore corrects map geometry, not an orientation or
specimen-reference-frame error.

Carrying the unit cell is exact for an affine transform. For a nonlinear transform, one
global unit cell can only represent the local transform at the map centre. The second
argument may be a `spatialTransform` or a plain function.

```python
ebsdT = transform(ebsd, S)

newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 2])
plot(ebsd, ebsd.bc, micronbar=False)
mtexColorMap('gray')
mtexTitle('as imported')
nextAxis()
plot(ebsdT, ebsdT.bc, micronbar=False)
mtexColorMap('gray')
mtexTitle('sheared')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EBSDSpatialTransform-18.png"></center>

The right map has a sheared footprint, while the band-contrast values keep the same
spatial order. The transform changed geometry, not the property.

Because this affine transform has an exact inverse, the original pixel positions are
recovered.

```python
ebsdBack = transform(ebsdT, inv(S))
np.max(norm(ebsdBack.pos - ebsd.pos))
```

```text
7.1054e-15
```

## Where the Point Pairs Come From

Nothing above measured a distortion: `posA` and `posB` were manufactured. In practice,
pairs often come from correlating two images of the same area.
[xcfShift](xcfShift.html) divides their shared region into tiles, phase correlates each
tile with its counterpart, and returns a displacement and correlation-peak height for every
tile.

The images must first share a pixel grid, and their stored order must refer to the same
specimen directions. With `mapImage` inputs, `xcfShift` returns positions and displacements
in specimen units rather than pixels.

The peak height is a fit weight, not a registration diagnostic. A tile on featureless
background must not receive an equal vote:

    u, peak, pos = xcfShift(imRef, imTest)
    T = spatialTransformShift.fit(pos, pos + u, weights=peak)

[Maps and Images](EBSDMapsAndImages_py.html) prepares that common geometry.
[TrueEBSD Distortion Correction](EBSDTrueEbsd_py.html) runs the complete chain on real data
and checks the residual after correction.

## Next

Continue with [TrueEBSD Distortion Correction](EBSDTrueEbsd_py.html) to fit a sequence of
physical distortion models to real EBSD and SEM images. See
[Square and Hex Grids](EBSDGrid_py.html) when the transformed map must recover or preserve
its lattice structure.

Correct the geometry before [grain reconstruction](GrainReconstruction_py.html) when grain
shape, boundary length, or correlative overlap matters. If grains already exist,
transform both the map and its grain map.
