<!--introduction-->

An orientation distribution function (ODF) lives on a three-dimensional space, so no
single plot contains all of it. A handful of numbers can say where the texture is
strongest, how concentrated it is, and what fraction of the material lies near a chosen
component. These are the quantities commonly quoted when textures are compared.

This page assumes the normalization and multiples of a random distribution (mrd)
introduced in [ODF Theory](ODFTheory_py.html). The model constructions come from
[ODF Modeling](ODFModeling_py.html). Every ODF below has mean 1, so its integrals can be
read as material fractions.

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Three ODFs to Measure

The first example is a bimodal ODF. Its two normalized components have equal mixture
weights, so the mixture also has mean 1.

```python
cs = crystalFrame('mmm')
odfBimodal = 0.5 * unimodalODF(orientation.byEuler(0, 0, 0, cs)) + 0.5 * unimodalODF(orientation.byEuler(30 * degree, 0, 0, cs))
```

The second example is a fibre ODF. It concentrates orientations around the fibre that
aligns the crystal direction $$(001)$$ with specimen X.

```python
f001X = fibre(Miller(0, 0, 1, cs), vector3d.X)
odfFibre = fibreODF(f001X)
```

The third example was estimated from neutron pole figures of quartz.
[The Dubna Example](PoleFigureDubna_py.html) reconstructs it from the measured files. Here
the cached reconstruction keeps the focus on its characteristics, while the measured
pole-figure directions remain available for the plot below.

```python
pf = mtexdata('dubna')
odfMeasured = mtexdata('dubnaODF')
```

## The Modal Orientation

A *mode* is a local maximum of the ODF. Its value is a density in mrd, not a percentage
of material. [max](SO3Fun.max.html) returns the global maximum and the orientation
where it is attained.

```python
peakValue, preferredOrientation = max(odfMeasured)
peakValue
```

```text
94.4039
```

---

```python
preferredOrientation
```

```text
orientation (Quartz → y↑→x)
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1   Phi  phi2
   133  35.7   205
```

The printed peak value is in mrd. The square markers show the poles of its orientation
on pole figures calculated from the measured ODF.

```python
plotPDF(odfMeasured, pf.allH, antipodal=True, superposition=pf.c)
annotate(preferredOrientation, marker='s', MarkerFaceColor='black')
mtexColorbar(title='mrd')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/ODFCharacteristics-8.png"></center>

In this example the markers lie in the strongest pole-density regions. That agreement is
a useful visual check, but it is not an identity: a pole figure integrates the ODF
along fibres, so its maximum need not be the projection of the ODF maximum.

Peak values are especially sensitive to the halfwidth and resolution used to estimate
an ODF. Compare them only when those choices are comparable.
[Density Estimation](DensityEstimation_py.html) explains the halfwidth choice.
[max(odf, numLocal=n)](SO3Fun.max.html) returns several local modes;
[Component Analysis](ODFComponents_py.html) explains how to interpret them.

## Texture Index

The texture index, also called the J-index, is the mean square of a normalized ODF,

$$ J(f) = \int_{SO(3)} f(R)^2\,\mathrm{d}R. $$

The orientation-space measure is normalized as in ODF Theory. The index is 1 for a
uniform texture and grows without bound as a texture sharpens. A direct numerical
integration gives

```python
textureIndexByMean = mean(odfBimodal * odfBimodal)
textureIndexByMean
```

```text
72.1700
```

The same quantity is obtained faster and more accurately from harmonic coefficients by
squaring the [norm](SO3Fun.norm.html).

```python
textureIndexBimodal = norm(odfBimodal) ** 2
textureIndexBimodal
```

```text
72.1700
```

The two printed values agree up to the quadrature error of the direct calculation. The
measured ODF has a much smaller index, so its texture is much weaker than the model
built from two sharp components.

```python
textureIndexMeasured = norm(odfMeasured) ** 2
textureIndexMeasured
```

```text
16.3418
```

## Entropy

Entropy is another global measure of concentration,

$$ H(f) = -\int_{SO(3)} f(R)\ln f(R)\,\mathrm{d}R. $$

It runs in the opposite direction: it is 0 for the uniform ODF and is negative for every
nonuniform ODF. A sharper distribution has a more negative entropy.

```python
fibreEntropy = entropy(odfFibre)
fibreEntropy
```

```text
-2.8385
```

Texture index and entropy both summarize sharpness, but they are not interchangeable.
Two ODFs can have the same texture index and different entropies. Like the maximum,
both values change when smoothing changes; report the ODF estimation choices with them.

## Volume Fractions

A volume fraction asks a more local question: what fraction of the material lies within
a chosen disorientation angle of an orientation or a fibre?
[volume](SO3Fun.volume.html) integrates the normalized ODF over either region.

```python
preferredVolumePercent = 100 * volume(odfMeasured, preferredOrientation, 30 * degree)
preferredVolumePercent
```

```text
38.2540
```

The printed result is the percentage within $$30^\circ$$ of the preferred orientation.
Around a fibre, the same command integrates a tube in orientation space.

```python
fibreVolumePercent = 100 * volume(odfFibre, f001X, 20 * degree)
fibreVolumePercent
```

```text
94.0354
```

The printed fibre fraction is large because this ODF is the chosen fibre spread with
the default halfwidth. Integrated fractions are generally more stable than a peak value
when the integration radius is broader than the smoothing scale.

The radius remains part of the result and must be reported. Regions around different
components can overlap, so their separately calculated volume fractions need not add
to 100 percent. Volume fractions are what turn a density into a statement about the
material, as explained in [ODF Theory](ODFTheory_py.html).

## Technical Details

`mtexdata('dubnaODF')` reconstructs the ODF from the pole figures on the spot where
MATLAB loads a cached file, so its numbers are those of the port's `calcODF`. `max(odf)`
returns the pair of the value and the orientation, and the product of two functions is
`odf * odf`.
