<!--introduction-->

Diffraction counts are not pole densities. The detector also records background
radiation, and tilting the specimen may reduce the measured intensity through
defocusing. Isolated bad measurements and an unknown scale introduce further errors.

This page prepares measured pole figures for ODF reconstruction. It assumes the
pole-figure idea from [Pole Figures](PoleFigureAnalysis.html) and the import checks from
[Import](PoleFigureImport_py.html).

A `PoleFigure` behaves like an array of measured values. Pole figures can be selected,
added and scaled, while individual values can be selected, overwritten or deleted.

```python
import numpy as np
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y←↑x')
pf = mtexdata('geesthacht')

pf
```

```text
PoleFigure (m3̅m → y←↑x)
  h = {104}, r = 679 points
  h = {104}, r = 16 points
  h = {110}, r = 679 points
  h = {110}, r = 16 points
```

```python
# plot the four entries in the imported object
plot(pf)
mtexColorbar()
```

## Splitting signal and background

The display and plot show four entries. The first and third are the two complete
intensity scans, with 679 specimen directions each. The second and fourth are sparse
background scans with 16 directions each.

Each background panel is a single radial line of points running from the centre of the
disc outward: the 16 directions share one azimuth and differ only in polar angle. They
belong to the complete scan with the same Miller index. A list of positions in brackets
selects entries of the `PoleFigure` object.

```python
pf_complete = pf[[0, 2]]
pf_background = pf[[1, 3]]
```

## Arithmetic with pole figures

Arithmetic uses the same syntax as arithmetic with numbers. The following weighted sum
demonstrates addition and scaling without changing `pf`.

```python
pf_weighted = 2 * pf[0] + 3 * pf[2]
```

The weights above are arbitrary and the two entries have different Miller indices. This
is an API example, not a physical correction or an example of an unresolved diffraction
peak.

## Background and defocusing

[correct](PoleFigure.correct.html) applies correction measurements that have already
been obtained. It does not infer background or defocusing from the measured pole figure.

With `background`, MTEX interpolates each sparse background scan onto the directions of
its complete scan and subtracts it. Because these background points differ only in
polar angle, that interpolation is a spline in the polar angle alone. The Geesthacht
data contain the background measurements needed for this operation.

```python
pf = correct(pf_complete, background=pf_background)

# compare the first scan before and after background subtraction
plot(cat(pf_complete[0], pf[0]), layout=[1, 2])
setColorRange('equal')
mtexColorbar()

correctedI = pf.intensities
print(f'Corrected counts: min {np.min(correctedI):.0f}, mean {np.mean(correctedI):.0f}, max {np.max(correctedI):.0f}')
```

```text
Corrected counts: min 7, mean 273, max 631
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PoleFigureCorrection-6.png"></center>

The left panel is the raw (104) scan and the right panel is the corrected scan on the
same colour range. Background subtraction preserves the broad intensity pattern while
lowering every value. The corrected counts run from 7 to 631, with an arithmetic mean of
273.

Defocusing is different: it is a tilt-dependent loss of signal, so the correction is a
division. Supply a defocusing measurement and, when available, its own background
measurement:

    pf = correct(pf, background=pf_bg, defocusing=pf_def, defocusingBackground=pf_def_bg)

MTEX subtracts `pf_bg` from `pf`, subtracts `pf_def_bg` from `pf_def`, and divides the
first result by the second. The correction measurements must match the pole figures
physically; interpolation only adapts their sampled directions.

## Normalization

Pole density is reported in multiples of a random distribution (mrd). Its mean over a
complete pole figure is 1, so [normalize](PoleFigure.normalize.html) divides each
complete scan by its quadrature-weighted mean.

```python
pf_normalized = normalize(pf)
plot(pf_normalized)
mtexColorbar()

normalizedI = pf_normalized.intensities
normalizedMean = mean(pf_normalized)
print(f'Normalized mrd: min {np.min(normalizedI):.2f}, max {np.max(normalizedI):.2f}; '
      f'pole-figure means {normalizedMean[0]:.2f} and {normalizedMean[1]:.2f}')
```

```text
Normalized mrd: min 0.03, max 2.27; pole-figure means 1.00 and 1.00
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PoleFigureCorrection-7.png"></center>

The pattern has not moved; only the colour scale has changed. Values now run from 0.03
to 2.27 mrd, and both pole figures have mean 1. They can therefore be compared with
normalized measurements from another specimen.

MATLAB reports 2.15 for the same data. Its two scans carry different antipodal flags
after the correction, so their quadrature weights differ although their specimen
directions are identical. Here both scans are axes, as diffraction data are, and both
are weighted the same way.

## Incomplete pole figures

Direct normalization fails for an incomplete pole figure. The unmeasured part of the
sphere also carries pole density, and its contribution is exactly what is unknown.

One route is to reconstruct an ODF first. The ODF fills in the unmeasured part, and
`normalize(pf, odf)` determines the scale against recalculated values at the measured
directions. ODF reconstruction is explained in
[ODF Reconstruction](PoleFigure2ODF_py.html).

```python
odf = calcODF(pf)
pf_normalized_odf = normalize(pf, odf)

plot(pf_normalized_odf)
mtexColorbar()

odfNormalizedMean = mean(pf_normalized_odf)
normalizationDifference = 100 * np.max(np.abs(odfNormalizedMean - 1))
print(f'Largest ODF-based scale difference: {normalizationDifference:.2f} percent')
```

```text
Largest ODF-based scale difference: 0.02 percent
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PoleFigureCorrection-8.png"></center>

These pole figures are complete, so the direct and ODF-based scales differ by at most
0.02 percent. Their plots are consequently almost indistinguishable. On incomplete data
the two procedures need not agree.

## Outliers

A single bad measurement can distort a reconstruction because the solver has no reason
to distrust it. [isOutlier](PoleFigure.isOutlier.html) marks values that disagree with
the mean of their neighbourhood.

The default threshold is two standard deviations for each pole figure. Review the
flagged points in the measurement context instead of treating the default as an
automatic quality criterion.

To make the operation visible, first spoil 100 random measurements.

```python
rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
ind = rng.permutation(pf.intensities.size)[:100]
factor = 3 + rng.random(100)
I = pf.intensities
I[ind] *= factor
pf.intensities = I

plot(pf)
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PoleFigureCorrection-9.png"></center>

The spoiled measurements appear as isolated bright dots above the broad texture
pattern. Deleting selected entries keeps the complement of a logical condition, as it
does for an ordinary NumPy array.

```python
condition = isOutlier(pf)
nFirstPass = np.count_nonzero(condition)
print(f'Outliers removed on first pass: {nFirstPass}')
pf = pf[~condition]

plot(pf)
mtexColorbar()
```

```text
Outliers removed on first pass: 52
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PoleFigureCorrection-10.png"></center>

The first pass removes about half of the 100 inserted values. An outlier beside another
outlier raises the local mean and can hide behind it. Recomputing the condition after
deletion catches roughly half of the rest.

```python
condition = isOutlier(pf)
nSecondPass = np.count_nonzero(condition)
print(f'Outliers removed on second pass: {nSecondPass}')
pf = pf[~condition]

plot(pf)
mtexColorbar()
```

```text
Outliers removed on second pass: 26
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PoleFigureCorrection-11.png"></center>

Most isolated bright points have disappeared after the second pass. The remaining
inserted values were not separated far enough from their local neighbourhood to pass
this particular threshold.

Deletion removes both the intensity and its specimen direction. It does not replace the
value by an interpolated estimate.

## Any other condition

Nothing about the selection is specific to outliers. Any logical condition on the
intensities can select values for deletion or replacement.

The next threshold is deliberately artificial: it demonstrates replacement by capping
counts at 500, not a recommended experimental correction. `min(pf, 500)` clips every
intensity above 500 to that value.

```python
condition = pf.intensities > 500
nCapped = np.count_nonzero(condition)
nRemaining = pf.intensities.size
print(f'Values capped at 500: {nCapped} of {nRemaining}')
pf = min(pf, 500)

plot(pf)
mtexColorbar()
```

```text
Values capped at 500: 99 of 1280
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PoleFigureCorrection-12.png"></center>

The cap affects about a hundred of the remaining measurements. They now share the same
top colour, flattening the bright parts of the plot and showing why a numerical
condition needs a physical justification.

## Rotating pole figures

A reference frame is the coordinate system in which the specimen directions are
expressed. If import assigned the wrong specimen frame, fix the import as described in
[Import](PoleFigureImport_py.html) whenever possible.

The following example deliberately rotates the measured directions by 100 degrees about
the x-axis. This moves the data; it is not a change of plotting convention, which only
controls where axes are drawn.

```python
rot = rotation.byAxisAngle(xvector, 100 * degree)
pf_rotated = rotate(pf, rot)

plot(pf_rotated, antipodal=True)
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/PoleFigureCorrection-13.png"></center>

[rotate](PoleFigure.rotate.html) leaves the intensities unchanged and applies the
rotation to their measured directions. The measured cap tips across the equator, and
`antipodal` folds the part below the equator back into the same disc.

Both panels come out filled edge to edge, and the vertical arcs across them are the
rotated ring sampling rather than gaps in it. Drop `antipodal` and the (110) panel opens
over the part of the sphere that was never measured. That is why correcting the specimen
frame at import is preferable to an avoidable rotation later.

## Technical Details

An integer, a slice or a list in brackets picks pole figures, a boolean mask picks
measurements, so MATLAB's `pf({1,3})` is `pf[[0, 2]]` and `pf(condition) = []` is
`pf = pf[~condition]`. `pf.intensities` is a copy of all intensities in one array;
changed values go back through the same property. The cap is `min(pf, 500)`, MATLAB's
`min(pf, 500)` as well. The spoiled measurements are drawn from a seeded generator so
that the page rebuilds the same; MATLAB's `randperm` is not seeded, and the counts of
the two passes vary with the draw.
