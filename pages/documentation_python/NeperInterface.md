<!--introduction-->

[Neper](https://neper.info) is an open-source package developed by Romain Quey for
generating and meshing polycrystals. MTEX can configure a Neper tessellation, run it, and
load the result as a `grain3d` collection. A synthetic volume lets us vary morphology and
texture independently, test how sectioning changes a measured distribution, or prepare
grain geometry for a simulation. [Three-Dimensional Grains](Grains3D_py.html) defines that
representation and introduces selection and sectioning.

A planar section is useful when the three-dimensional microstructure must be compared
with a two-dimensional map. It is not required for analysing the original `grain3d`
collection.

```python
import os
import tempfile
```

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Check the external program

Install Neper separately and make its executable available on the system path. Its
[documentation](https://neper.info/doc/) gives platform-specific installation
instructions. The preference `neperCommand` names another executable.

The check below keeps this page executable on systems without Neper. In that case, the
simulation section loads a bundled tessellation explicitly. This avoids mistaking an old
output file for a successful new simulation.

```python
hasNeper = neper.init().available()
```

## Choose files and geometry

`neper.init` returns the interface object. By default, Neper works in
`os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), 'neper')`. Keeping generated files under the
temporary directory prevents a documentation run from overwriting a project
tessellation.

The default three-dimensional base name is `allgrains`, and the default two-dimensional
base name is `2dslice`. Neper adds `.tess` and `.ori`; three-dimensional output may also
include `.stpoly`. Assign `filePath`, `fileName3d`, or `fileName2d` when these defaults
are unsuitable.

```python
if hasNeper:
  neper = neper.init()
  neper.filePath = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), 'mtex-neper-doc')
  neper.fileName3d = 'my100grains'
  neper.fileName2d = 'my100GrSlice'
```

For example, an existing project directory could be selected with

    neper.filePath = 'C:/Users/user/Documents/work/MtexWork/neper'

Neper coordinates set relative lengths; choose their physical scale for the intended
material or simulation. The `geometry` property controls the outer domain. Its default is
`"cube(1,1,1)"`. Cuboids use `"cube(x,y,z)"`; cylinders use `"cylinder(h,d,numFaces)"`;
spheres use `"sphere(d,numFaces)"`.

```python
if hasNeper:
  neper.geometry = "cube(4,4,2)"
```

## Control repeatability and morphology

Neper uses the integer `id` as the seed for the initial seed positions. Reusing it makes
the initial tessellation repeatable. The default is `1`.

The `morpho` string sets the target cell morphology. The default `'graingrowth'` is an
alias for the lognormal equivalent-diameter and sphericity distributions below. Neper
documents further choices under
[morphology options](https://neper.info/doc/neper_t.html#cmdoption-morpho).

```python
if hasNeper:
  neper.id = 529
  neper.morpho = 'diameq:lognormal(1,0.35),1-sphericity:lognormal(0.145,0.03)'
```

## Simulate a textured microstructure

`simulateGrains` accepts either an orientation distribution function
([ODF](ODFTheory_py.html)) and a grain count, or a list of orientations. For a list, its
length determines the grain count. With `silent=True` Neper's console output goes to
`neper.log` in `filePath`. Both the generated grains and the imported example use the
ODF's trigonal quartz symmetry, also used on the Properties and Operations pages.

```python
# the Dubna ODF has trigonal quartz symmetry
odf = SO3Fun.dubna()
numGrains = 100

if hasNeper:
  grains = neper.simulateGrains(numGrains, odf, verbose=False)
else:
  tessFile = mtexdatafile('my100grains')[0]
  grains = grain3d.load(tessFile, CS=odf.CS)
print(grains)
```

```text
grain3d (y↑→x)
  Phase  Grains           Mineral  Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      100 (volume 32)  Quartz   LightSkyBlue  321       Quartz
  boundary faces: 643
```

To prescribe every orientation rather than sample the ODF internally, use

    ori = odf.discreteSample(numGrains)
    grains = neper.simulateGrains(ori, silent=True)

The summary confirms that the result is a three-dimensional grain collection. The
fallback is an existing example, not a realization of the settings above: it retains its
stored geometry and orientations. The ODF controls grain orientations, not a
boundary-normal distribution or a constitutive law.

```python
plot(grains, grains.meanOrientation, micronbar='off', edgeAlpha=0.1)
how2plot = plottingConvention.default3D
setCamera(how2plot)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><a href="figures/python/NeperInterface-10.html"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/NeperInterface-10.png"></a></center>

The colours encode one mean orientation per polyhedral grain. The outer envelope follows
the cuboid selected by the simulation that created this tessellation.

## Check the generated size distribution

A morphology string specifies a target, not the measured outcome of a finite
tessellation. Check the resulting equivalent-sphere diameters before treating the volume
as a representative microstructure. Normalizing by the mean separates the spread from the
chosen length scale.

```python
diameter = (6 * grains.volume / np.pi) ** (1 / 3)
newMtexFigure()
histogram(diameter / diameter.mean(), 15)
plt.xlabel('equivalent-sphere diameter / mean diameter')
plt.ylabel('number of grains')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/NeperInterface-11.png"></center>

Use several seeds and, when needed, more grains to assess sampling variability. A
prescribed list of orientations gives one orientation per grain; unequal grain volumes
mean its volume-weighted texture can differ from the number-weighted orientation sample.

## Compare planar sections

The earlier [sectioning example](Grains3D_py.html) defines `slice`. A slice normal and
either a point in the plane or its signed distance from the origin specify the cutting
plane. Here all three sections pass through the centre of the collection.

```python
N = [vector3d(0, 0, 1), vector3d(1, -1, 0), vector3d(2, 2, 4)]
A = grains.midPoint

grains001 = grains.slice(N[0], A)
grains1_10 = grains.slice(N[1], A)
grains224 = grains.slice(N[2], A)
print(grains224)

newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 3], figSize='large')
plot(grains001, grains001.meanOrientation, micronbar='off')
mtexTitle('normal || specimen z')
nextAxis()
plot(grains1_10, grains1_10.meanOrientation, micronbar='off')
mtexTitle('normal || (1,-1,0)')
nextAxis()
plot(grains224, grains224.meanOrientation, micronbar='off')
mtexTitle('normal || (2,2,4)')
```

```text
grain2d (y↑→x)
  size: 49
  Phase  Grains          Mineral  Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      49 (49 pixels)  Quartz   LightSkyBlue  321       Quartz
  boundary segments: 150, inner: 0, triple points: 72
  properties       : Id3d
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/NeperInterface-12.png"></center>

The three panels show differently oriented planes. Their unequal outlines show how the
same cuboid and its grains are sampled by horizontal and oblique sections. `grains.slice`
cuts the loaded collection itself, with no external file.

## Relate a section to its parent grains

`intersected` selects the full polyhedra crossed by a plane. Overlaying those grains on
the horizontal section connects each planar polygon to the three-dimensional material
that produced it.

```python
inPlane = grains.intersected(N[0], A)

plot(grains001, grains001.meanOrientation, micronbar='off')
hold(True)
plot(grains[inPlane], grains[inPlane].meanOrientation, faceAlpha=0.55, edgeAlpha=0.1)
hold(False)
setCamera(how2plot)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><a href="figures/python/NeperInterface-13.html"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/NeperInterface-13.png"></a></center>

The opaque polygons are the section itself. The translucent polyhedra extend to both
sides of the plane and are the corresponding parent grains.

## Technical details

`neper = neper.init()` binds the one interface to the name MATLAB's static class uses, so
that the assignments read as MATLAB's. The orientations of the simulated grains are
sampled at random, so the pictures differ from MATLAB's in their colours. MATLAB's `neper.getSlice`, a section written by
Neper to a file, is left out: `grains.slice` cuts the loaded grains directly.
