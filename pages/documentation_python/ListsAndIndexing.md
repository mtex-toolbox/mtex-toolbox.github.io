<!--introduction-->

Almost every MTEX variable is a list of objects of one kind. An [EBSD](EBSD.EBSD.html)
variable is a list of measurements, a [grain2d](grain2d.grain2d.html) variable is a list
of grains, and `grains.boundary` is a list of grain boundary segments. An
[orientation](orientation.orientation.html) variable commonly stores a list of
orientations.

There is no separate type for one grain. A single grain is a `grain2d` list with length
one.

Two consequences account for most list operations in MTEX.

* An elementwise function or property acts on every list element. It usually returns one
  result per element: `grains.area` gives one area per grain, and `ori.angle()` gives one
  angle per orientation. Reduction functions such as `mean` are exceptions because they
  combine several elements into one result. Loops are therefore almost never needed for
  elementwise calculations.
* Square bracket indexing selects elements as it does for a NumPy array. The result is a
  list of the same kind, so an operation that accepts the complete list also accepts the
  selection.

The diagram compares the two main forms of indexing. Position indices pick specified list
entries in the requested order. A logical condition keeps the entries whose mask value is
true.

The sections that follow show the indexing itself on plain numbers, for clarity. The same
two forms then apply unchanged to any MTEX list.

```python
import numpy as np
```

## Make a list

`np.array` creates a list by placing values next to one another.

```python
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
x
```

```text
array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
```

`np.arange` is shorthand for a regularly spaced range. With no step specified, it uses a
step of one. Its end is exclusive, so the range 1 to 10 is `np.arange(1, 11)`.

```python
x = np.arange(1, 11)
x
```

```text
array([ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10])
```

## Apply an operation to every element

NumPy applies arithmetic operations elementwise. `x**2` squares every element of `x`
independently; a matrix power is `np.linalg.matrix_power`.

```python
y = x**2
y
```

```text
array([  1,   4,   9,  16,  25,  36,  49,  64,  81, 100])
```

## Select by position

A list of positions selects those elements in the given order. Here, `ind` selects the
first, third, and fifth squared values. Python counts positions from zero, so the first
element has position 0.

```python
ind = [0, 2, 4]
ind
```

```text
[0, 2, 4]
```

```python
y[ind]
```

```text
array([ 1,  9, 25])
```

## Select by condition

A condition evaluated for the complete list returns one logical value per element. A
logical value is either true or false. It can be used as an index to retain only the
corresponding true entries.

```python
cond = x % 2 == 0
cond
```

```text
array([False,  True, False,  True, False,  True, False,  True, False,
        True])
```

```python
y[cond]
```

```text
array([  4,  16,  36,  64, 100])
```

The condition tests which values in `x` are even. Using the same mask to index `y`
returns their squares. This works because `x` and `y` have the same length and order.

## Use the same pattern with MTEX objects

Nearly every MTEX selection has the same form. For example,
`grains[grains.area > 100]` selects grains with area greater than 100,
`ebsd[ebsd.mad < 1]` selects measurements with a mean angular deviation below 1, and
`gB[gB.misorientation.angle() > 10*degree]` selects grain boundary segments with a
misorientation angle greater than 10 degrees.

In each expression, MTEX computes one property value per object. The comparison turns
those values into a logical mask, and the brackets apply the mask to the original list.

MTEX also provides two domain-specific selectors. A phase name selects all measurements of
that phase, as in `ebsd['Forsterite']`. For spatial data, a position selects the object
found there, as in `grains(x, y)`. See [Selecting Grains](SelectingGrains_py.html)
for spatial grain selections.

## Technical Details

MATLAB counts from one and its ranges `1:10` include the end; Python counts from zero and
`np.arange(1, 11)` excludes it. The values and the selections are MATLAB's, the positions
one less. A map read from a regular grid is a two-dimensional list in the port, so
`ebsd[ebsd.mad < 1]` returns the selected measurements as a one-dimensional list, as NumPy
does for a boolean mask.
