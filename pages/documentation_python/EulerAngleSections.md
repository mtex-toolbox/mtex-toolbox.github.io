<!--introduction-->

An orientation distribution function (ODF) is defined on the three-dimensional space of
orientations. A section plot makes this space readable on a page by evaluating the ODF
on several two-dimensional slices and placing the slices side by side. A section is not
a projection: it does not integrate density from neighbouring orientations.

This page assumes the ODF normalization introduced in [ODF Theory](ODFTheory_py.html).
[Plotting an ODF](ODFPlot_py.html) compares sections with three-dimensional plots, pole
figures, and inverse pole figures. The Bunge and Matthies angle conventions are
introduced in [Rotation Representations](RotationRepresentations_py.html).

The plotting convention below draws specimen Y upward and X to the right. It changes
only the screen layout, not the ODF or its reference frame.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## A Model with Known Features

The example combines the brass and copper components with the beta fibre. The
coefficients 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 are mixture fractions of normalized components. They are
not the peak heights seen in a section.

```python
cs = crystalFrame.load('Al-Aluminum.cif')

ori1 = orientation.brass(cs)
ori2 = orientation.copper(cs)
f = fibre.beta(cs)

odf = 0.2 * unimodalODF(ori1) + 0.3 * unimodalODF(ori2) + 0.5 * fibreODF(f)
```

## Default Bunge Sections

[plotSection](SO3Fun.plotSection.html) uses sections at constant third Bunge angle
$$\varphi_2$$ by default. Here the explicit `'phi2'` flag makes that choice visible. The
option `sections` sets the number of panels; it does not set the angular resolution
within a panel.

```python
plotSection(odf, 'phi2', sections=9, verbose=False, layout=[5, 2], figSize='large')

annotate(ori1, markerSize=15)
annotate(ori2, marker='v', markerSize=15)
plot(f, lineWidth=2, add2all=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EulerAngleSections-5.png"></center>

The square and triangle locate the brass and copper component centres. The line follows
the beta fibre. A localized component is confined to nearby panels, whereas the fibre
continues across a sequence of panels. The nine panels sample the available
$$\varphi_2$$ period without repeating its equivalent endpoint.

## Choosing the Section Angles

Pass explicit angle values with an option named after the fixed coordinate. The
following four panels restrict the display to $$\varphi_2=25^\circ$$, $$30^\circ$$,
$$35^\circ$$, and $$40^\circ$$. Constructing [phi2Sections](phi2Sections.html) explicitly
records this geometry so it can be reused for several ODFs or orientation sets.

```python
sectionAngles = np.array([25, 30, 35, 40]) * degree
oS = phi2Sections(odf.CS, odf.SS, phi2=sectionAngles)

plotSection(odf, oS, verbose=False, figSize='large', layout=[2, 2])
annotate(ori1, markerSize=15)
annotate(ori2, marker='v', markerSize=15)
plot(f, lineWidth=2, add2all=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EulerAngleSections-6.png"></center>

This restricted gallery resolves how the beta fibre passes through a narrow interval
instead of spending space on the full period. Explicit values select slices; they do
not average the ODF between those values.

## Choosing a Section Family

MTEX can hold any Bunge or Matthies Euler coordinate constant. Each family uses its own
option name for explicit section values.

| flag | fixed coordinate | explicit values |
|---|---|---|
| `'phi2'` | third Bunge angle $$\varphi_2$$ | `phi2=values` |
| `'phi1'` | first Bunge angle $$\varphi_1$$ | `phi1=values` |
| `'Phi'` | second Bunge angle $$\Phi$$ | `Phi=values` |
| `'gamma'` | Matthies angle $$\gamma$$ | `gamma=values` |
| `'alpha'` | Matthies angle $$\alpha$$ | `alpha=values` |
| `'sigma'` | Matthies coordinate $$\sigma=\alpha+\gamma$$ | `sigma=values` |

The corresponding classes are [phi2Sections](phi2Sections.html),
[phi1Sections](phi1Sections.html), [PhiSections](PhiSections.html),
[gammaSections](gammaSections.html), [alphaSections](alphaSections.html), and
[sigmaSections](sigmaSections.html). They share layout, resolution, and the
[plot-type](PlotTypes_py.html) options. The `secResolution` option is specific to
`phi2Sections` and sets the spacing between its section angles.

## Sigma Sections

Sigma sections are special. For the usual choice of reference axes, a position within a
$$\sigma$$ section is the specimen direction of the crystal axis $$\vec c^*$$. The section
angle describes the remaining rotation about that direction. A panel can therefore be
read much like a pole figure with one extra angular coordinate.

MTEX defines the Matthies coordinate as $$\sigma=\alpha+\gamma$$. Do not replace it by an
informal expression in the Bunge angles; the coordinate conventions and reference fields
matter.

```python
plotSection(odf, 'sigma', verbose=False, figSize='large')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EulerAngleSections-7.png"></center>

The same brass, copper, and fibre contributions are now arranged by the specimen
direction of the crystal axis $$\vec c^*$$ and by rotation about it. No density has been
added or removed; only the coordinates of the slices have changed.
[Sigma Sections](SigmaSections_py.html) develops this geometric reading for crystals with
a distinguished axis.

## Other Euler Coordinates

Sections at constant first Bunge angle $$\varphi_1$$ put $$\varphi_2$$ and $$\Phi$$ within
each panel.

```python
plotSection(odf, 'phi1', sections=6, layout=[3, 2], verbose=False, figSize='large')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EulerAngleSections-8.png"></center>

Features that were split mainly along $$\varphi_1$$ in the default view now remain within
one panel, while features extended along $$\varphi_1$$ pass through several panels. This
is the same ODF sampled on a different family of slices.

Sections at constant $$\gamma$$ make the analogous choice in the Matthies convention.

```python
plotSection(odf, 'gamma', sections=6, layout=[3, 2], verbose=False, figSize='large')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EulerAngleSections-9.png"></center>

The panels again redistribute the same features. A useful family is the one that keeps
the feature of interest compact and makes its relevant specimen or crystal direction
easy to read. It is not a different ODF.

## Euler Plotting Bounds and Crystal Symmetry

Bunge sections use the coordinates $$\varphi_1$$, $$\Phi$$, and $$\varphi_2$$. With identity
specimen symmetry, MTEX uses the following crystal-symmetry-dependent rectangular
plotting bounds.

| symmetry | 1 | 2 | 222 | 3 | 32 | 4 | 422 | 6 | 622 | 23 | 432 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $$\varphi_1$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ |
| $$\Phi$$ | $$180^{\circ}$$ | $$180^{\circ}$$ | $$90^{\circ}$$ | $$180^{\circ}$$ | $$90^{\circ}$$ | $$180^{\circ}$$ | $$90^{\circ}$$ | $$180^{\circ}$$ | $$90^{\circ}$$ | $$90^{\circ}$$ | $$90^{\circ}$$ |
| $$\varphi_2$$ | $$360^{\circ}$$ | $$180^{\circ}$$ | $$180^{\circ}$$ | $$120^{\circ}$$ | $$120^{\circ}$$ | $$90^{\circ}$$ | $$90^{\circ}$$ | $$60^{\circ}$$ | $$60^{\circ}$$ | $$180^{\circ}$$ | $$90^{\circ}$$ |

Crystal symmetry does not restrict the first Euler angle. With identity specimen
symmetry, $$\varphi_1$$ therefore spans $$0^\circ$$ through $$360^\circ$$ for every crystal
symmetry in the table. For point groups 23 and 432, this rectangular box does not
account for the threefold axis. Each orientation consequently appears three times
within the box.

fundamentalRegionEuler returns these
upper bounds for an arbitrary pair of crystal and specimen symmetries. They describe a
plotting box, not necessarily a compact fundamental region with exactly one
representative. The latter is introduced in
[Fundamental Regions](OrientationFundamentalRegion_py.html).

## Specimen Symmetry

Specimen symmetry can restrict the first Euler angle. Orthotropic specimen symmetry
reduces it to $$90^\circ$$ for this cubic example and produces the common square-shaped
ODF panels. Assigning a specimen symmetry changes the symmetry used to represent the
function; it does not rotate the texture or change its specimen reference frame. See
[Specimen Symmetry](SpecimenSymmetry_py.html) before applying such a symmetry to measured
data. A classical gallery at $$5^\circ$$ intervals can be requested with `sections=18`.
Six panels are sufficient here to show the changed bounds while keeping this executable
page practical.

```python
odfOrtho = odf
odfOrtho.SS = specimenFrame('222')

maxPhi1, maxPhi, maxPhi2 = fundamentalRegionEuler(odfOrtho.CS, odfOrtho.SS)
eulerBounds = np.array([maxPhi1, maxPhi, maxPhi2]) / degree
eulerBounds
```

```text
array([90., 90., 90.])
```

```python
plotSection(odfOrtho, 'phi2', sections=6, layout=[3, 2], coordinates='off', xlabel='', ylabel='', verbose=False, figSize='large')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/EulerAngleSections-11.png"></center>

The displayed bounds are $$90^\circ$$ by $$90^\circ$$ by $$90^\circ$$. Accordingly, every
panel is square, whereas the panels above spanned $$360^\circ$$ in $$\varphi_1$$. Specimen
symmetry has restricted $$\varphi_1$$ only; the $$\varphi_2$$ period is unchanged, so the
six panels still sample it from $$0^\circ$$ to $$90^\circ$$.

[Sigma Sections](SigmaSections_py.html) explains how to interpret and customize sigma
sections. The projections that integrate an ODF are [Pole Figures](ODFPoleFigure_py.html)
and [Inverse Pole Figures](ODFInversePoleFigure_py.html).

## Technical Details

`odfOrtho = odf` binds a second name to the same object, so assigning the specimen
symmetry changes both; MATLAB copies on assignment. The section values are keywords of
the family name, `phi2=sectionAngles`, as MATLAB's option pairs are.
