<!--introduction-->

A legend pairs a plotted symbol or line with a label. Use one when a small
number of discrete objects must be distinguished, such as selected grains,
boundary classes, or reference directions.

In MTEX, legend entries are opt in. An object appears only when it is
plotted with a `DisplayName`. This is the opposite of MATLAB's default
behaviour. It prevents markers, construction lines, and a colour-coded
background from each acquiring an unhelpful entry.

## Choose the legend entries

Name only the objects that the reader needs to distinguish. This example
names a point and a great circle. The pole at the centre remains unnamed.

```python
from mtex import *

plot(vector3d.X, upper=True, DisplayName='point')
hold(True)

circle(vector3d.X, DisplayName='great circle', lineColor='r', lineWidth=2)

plot(vector3d.Z, Marker='p', MarkerSize=30)
hold(False)

lgd = legend('show')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/Legends-1.png"></center>

## Read and adjust the result

The figure contains three plotted objects, but the legend has two entries.
The central star is visible in the axes but absent from the legend because
it has no `DisplayName`.

After MTEX has selected the entries, `legend` hands its options to matplotlib's
[legend](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/legend_api.html). Calling it again
replaces the legend: an outside location avoids covering the spherical plot,
and a title explains what the entries classify.

```python
lgd = legend('show', location='eastoutside', title='Geometry')
```

## Choose the right colour guide

A legend represents discrete identities. When colour represents a numerical
value, use a colour bar because it shows the complete value-to-colour scale.
When colour represents a direction or an orientation, use a colour key that
maps each possible direction or orientation to a colour. The next page
introduces numerical colour scales; [IPF Maps](EBSDIPFMap_py.html) explains
direction colour keys for orientation maps.

The matplotlib
[Legend properties](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/legend_api.html#matplotlib.legend.Legend)
provide further controls for placement and styling.

are translated into colours.

## Technical Details

MATLAB moves and titles the legend by setting `lgd.Location` and `lgd.Title.String` on its
handle; a matplotlib legend cannot be moved outside its axes after it is made, so the page
calls `legend` a second time with `location` and `title`.
