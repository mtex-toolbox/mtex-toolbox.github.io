<!--introduction-->

Density estimation turns a finite sample into a continuous function. In texture analysis,
the samples may be EBSD orientations, grain mean orientations, misorientation axes, or
simulated orientations.

Keep three parts of the calculation distinct:

* **input:** samples $$x_n$$, possibly with statistical weights;
* **assumption:** nearby samples belong to a smoothly varying density;
* **result:** an estimate $$f_N$$ of an unknown density $$f$$.

Pole-figure intensities are different input. They are sampled values of a projected pole
density rather than random orientations. Recovering an ODF from them is an inverse problem,
not the kernel estimate described here.

The worked sequence starts with real numbers. It then applies the same construction to
directions and orientations.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
```

## Begin with a finite sample

Use a mixture of two Gaussian densities as a known reference. The second argument of
`Gaussian` is a width parameter $$\delta$$. The profile is $$\exp(-(x-m)^2/\delta^2)$$, so
$$\delta$$ is the standard deviation times $$\sqrt{2}$$.

```python
f = lambda x: (Gaussian(0.2, 0.05, x) + Gaussian(0.5, 0.2, x)) / 2
x = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)

# draw a sample from the density on [0,1]
N = 20
xN = discreteSample(f, N, range=[0, 1], rng=rng)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, f(x), linewidth=2)
plt.plot(xN, np.zeros_like(xN), 'o', markeredgewidth=2, markeredgecolor='r', markerfacecolor='none')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('density')
plt.legend(['true density', 'sample'])
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-2.png"></center>

The blue curve has a narrow mode near 0.2 and a broad mode near 0.5. More red samples occur
where that curve is high. With only 20 samples, random gaps and clusters are still
prominent.

## A histogram depends on its bins

A histogram is the simplest density estimate. The `density=True` normalization puts the bar
areas on the same scale as the reference density.

```python
plt.figure()
plt.hist(xN, 10, density=True)
plt.plot(x, f(x), linewidth=2)
plt.plot(xN, np.zeros_like(xN), 'o', markeredgewidth=2, markeredgecolor='r', markerfacecolor='none')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('density')
plt.legend(['true density', 'sample', 'histogram'])
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-3.png"></center>

The estimate is piecewise constant, and changing the bin edges changes its steps. The bars
hint at two modes, but they do not follow either mode smoothly. Kernel density estimation
removes the bin edges.

## Replace each sample by a kernel

A *kernel* is a small density profile placed at one observation. Start with a Gaussian of
mean 0 and width 0.05.

```python
psi = Gaussian(0, 0.05)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(xN, np.zeros_like(xN), 'o', markeredgewidth=2, markeredgecolor='r', markerfacecolor='none')
for n in range(N):
  plt.plot(x, psi(x - xN[n]), 'k')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('kernel contribution')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-4.png"></center>

Every black curve has the same shape and total mass. Only its centre changes. Their mean is
the kernel density estimate.

```python
fN = lambda x: np.mean(psi(x[None, :] - xN[:, None]), axis=0)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, f(x), linewidth=3, color=ind2color(1))
plt.plot(x, fN(x), linewidth=3, color=ind2color(2))
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('density')
plt.legend(['true density', 'kernel estimate'])
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-5.png"></center>

The estimate is smooth, but it is not the true function. Its small peaks record the finite
sample as well as the two features of the source.

## Kernel width decides which detail survives

Repeat the estimate with widths 0.01, 0.05, and 0.25.

```python
delta = [0.01, 0.05, 0.25]

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, f(x), linewidth=3)
for d in delta:
  psiTrial = Gaussian(0, d)
  plt.plot(x, np.mean(psiTrial(x[None, :] - xN[:, None]), axis=0), linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('density')
plt.legend(['$f$', '$f_{0.01}$', '$f_{0.05}$', '$f_{0.25}$'])
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-6.png"></center>

The 0.01 estimate retains a noisy peak for almost every observation. The 0.25 estimate
merges the two source modes and lowers their peaks. The middle curve balances sample-scale
variation against lost structure. This is the bias--variance trade-off behind kernel
selection.

For one-dimensional real data, [calcDensity](calcDensity.html) selects a smoothing width
automatically. The estimate carries the width it chose as `bandwidth`.

```python
fAuto = calcDensity(xN, range=[0, 1])
autoBandwidth = fAuto.bandwidth
autoBandwidth
```

```text
0.0438
```

```python
plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, f(x), linewidth=2)
plt.plot(x, fAuto(x), linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('density')
plt.legend(['true density', 'automatic estimate'])
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-8.png"></center>

The automatic estimate smooths the sample without reproducing every observation as a
separate peak. In MATLAB's draw its left mode sits on the true one at $$x = 0.2$$, its right
mode near $$x = 0.67$$, well to the right of the true mode at $$x = 0.5$$, and the taller of the
two; the draw here is another one, so its modes sit elsewhere.

The bandwidth is estimated from the same twenty samples, and twenty samples do not locate
the broad component of the mixture. Read the estimate as one draw rather than as the density
itself.

For one-dimensional data, the `bandwidth` option fixes the smoothing parameter instead.

```python
fFixed = calcDensity(xN, range=[0, 1], bandwidth=0.004)
```

[Optimal Kernel Selection](OptimalKernel_py.html) explains why no single width is best for
every sample.

## The construction also works in several dimensions

Draw 100 independent pairs whose x and y coordinates follow the same mixture. A row of
`np.column_stack([xN, yN])` is now one two-dimensional observation.

```python
N = 100
xN = discreteSample(f, N, range=[0, 1], rng=rng)
yN = discreteSample(f, N, range=[0, 1], rng=rng)

plt.figure()
plt.scatter(xN, yN, facecolors='none', edgecolors='r', linewidths=2)
plt.axis('scaled')
plt.xlim([0, 1])
plt.ylim([0, 1])
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-10.png"></center>

The sample cloud is concentrated near combinations of the two one-dimensional modes. The
empty space between points is not assigned zero density; the next step estimates it from
neighbouring observations.

For $$d$$-dimensional data, the range has one column per coordinate. The first row contains
the minima, and the second contains the maxima.

```python
fN = calcDensity(np.column_stack([xN, yN]), range=[[0, 0], [1, 1]], rng=rng)

xGrid, yGrid = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(0, 1, 100), np.linspace(0, 1, 100), indexing='ij')
z = fN(xGrid, yGrid)
plt.figure()
levels = np.arange(0, z.max() + 2, 2)
plt.contourf(xGrid, yGrid, z, levels=levels)
plt.contour(xGrid, yGrid, z, levels=levels, colors='k', linewidths=0.5)
mtexColorMap('LaboTeX')
plt.axis('scaled')
plt.scatter(xN, yN, s=4, c='r')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-11.png"></center>

The estimate is positive everywhere, but most of the square carries very little of it. The
`LaboTeX` colour map starts at white, and most of the grid falls in the lowest contour band,
so the field reads as a few pink islands on a white ground.

White here means density below the first contour, not zero. The islands sit at the four
combinations of the two one-dimensional modes. The pair of narrow modes near $$x = 0.2$$,
$$y = 0.2$$ is by far the densest, and the pair of broad modes near $$x = 0.5$$, $$y = 0.5$$ is the
faintest.

## Directions need kernels on the sphere

A directional kernel uses angular distance on the sphere rather than ordinary distance on a
line. As a crystallographic example, estimate the distribution of misorientation axes along
one phase boundary population. A misorientation axis is the direction about which one
crystal must be rotated to match the other.

```python
ebsd = mtexdata('forsterite', verbose=False)
grains = calcGrains(ebsd)

# Select boundaries between forsterite and enstatite grains.
gB = grains.boundary['Forsterite', 'Enstatite']
# the axes are taken with respect to the forsterite frame, the first of the misorientation
misAxes = gB.misorientation.axis()

plot(misAxes, fundamentalRegion=True, markerFaceAlpha=0.1)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-12.png"></center>

Symmetry maps equivalent axes into the same fundamental region. The points cluster instead
of covering that region uniformly, so a density can summarize their preferred directions.

```python
# boundary segments of one grain pair repeat an axis, so the halfwidth is named
axisDensity = calcDensity(misAxes, halfwidth=10 * degree)

contourf(axisDensity)
mtexColorMap('LaboTeX')
mtexColorbar()
hold(True)
plot(misAxes, markerEdgeAlpha=0.25, markerFaceColor='none', markerEdgeColor='k')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-13.png"></center>

The contours join nearby black observations into broad maxima. The result is an
`S2FunHarmonic` with the symmetry of the frame and supports the operations in
[Spherical Function Operations](S2FunOperations_py.html).

Repeat the calculation with a 5 degree halfwidth.

```python
axisDensity5 = calcDensity(misAxes, halfwidth=5 * degree)

contourf(axisDensity5)
mtexColorMap('LaboTeX')
mtexColorbar()
hold(True)
plot(misAxes, markerEdgeAlpha=0.25, markerFaceColor='none', markerEdgeColor='k')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-14.png"></center>

The smaller halfwidth keeps narrower, more fragmented maxima around the observations. That
extra detail is not automatically extra information; it may be sampling variation.

## Orientations need kernels in orientation space

Applying the construction to orientations produces an *orientation distribution function*
(ODF). An ODF is a density over the possible crystal orientations of one phase in the
specimen.

```python
forsteriteOri = ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations
odf = calcDensity(forsteriteOri, halfwidth=10 * degree)
odf
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (Forsterite → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 25
  mean     : 1
```

```python
plotSection(odf, contourf=True)
mtexColorMap('LaboTeX')
hold(True)
plot(forsteriteOri, markerEdgeAlpha=0.25, markerFaceColor='none', markerEdgeColor='k', markerSize=10)
hold(False)
```

```text
plot 2000 random orientations out of 152345 given orientations
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/DensityEstimation-16.png"></center>

Each section cuts through the continuous ODF. The black measurements concentrate around the
same section maxima, while the kernel fills the space between them.
[ODF Estimation from EBSD Data](EBSD2ODF_py.html) treats phase selection, correlated EBSD
pixels, and ODF interpretation in detail.

## Weights decide what population the density describes

A weighted sample gives some observations more mass than others. Grain orientations make
the physical choice clear. Equal weights answer "what fraction of grains has this
orientation?" Pixel-count weights approximate "what fraction of the mapped area has this
orientation?"

```python
ebsd = mtexdata('titanium', verbose=False)
grains = calcGrains(ebsd)
indexedGrains = grains['indexed']

# one halfwidth for both, MATLAB's default, so that only the weights differ
odfEqual = calcDensity(indexedGrains.meanOrientation, halfwidth=10 * degree)
odfByPixel = calcDensity(indexedGrains.meanOrientation, weights=indexedGrains.numPixel, halfwidth=10 * degree)

weighting = ['equal grains', 'grain pixel count']
peakMRD = [max(odfEqual)[0], max(odfByPixel)[0]]
for w, p in zip(weighting, peakMRD):
  print(f'{w:<20}{p:.4f}')
```

```text
equal grains        7.4525
grain pixel count   9.0181
```

The unequal peaks, 7.6274 and 8.9863 mrd in MATLAB, show that weighting changes the
estimated population, not just the plotting style. On a regular map, pixel count is
proportional to mapped area. State the sampling unit before interpreting an ODF.

## Parametric estimation answers a different question

Kernel estimation assumes smoothness but does not prescribe one global shape. *Parametric
density estimation* instead assumes that the unknown density belongs to a chosen family and
estimates that family's parameters.

For a Gaussian, those parameters are the mean and standard deviation. The analogous models
on spheres and in orientation space are Bingham distributions. See
[Spherical Bingham Distribution](S2Bingham_py.html) and [Bingham ODFs](BinghamODFs_py.html) for
fitting and checking those models.

## The maths behind kernel density estimation

For equally weighted samples $$x_1,\ldots,x_N$$ and a normalized kernel $$\psi$$, the estimate
is

$$ f_N(x) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \psi(x-x_n). $$

Each observation contributes the same total mass. The kernel decides how far that mass
spreads. For non-negative weights $$w_n$$, MTEX replaces the equal average by a normalized
weighted sum.

On the rotation group, let $$o_n$$ be orientations and let $$\psi$$ be a radially symmetric
kernel. The weighted ODF estimate is

$$ f(o) = \frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_j} \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \psi(o o_n^{-1}). $$

MTEX also accounts for the symmetry-equivalent representatives carried by each
orientation. Different phases generally have different crystal symmetries, so estimate an
EBSD-derived ODF from one selected phase at a time. [Kernels on SO(3)](SO3Kernels_py.html)
compares the kernel families.
