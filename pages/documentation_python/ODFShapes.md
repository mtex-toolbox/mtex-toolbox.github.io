<!--introduction-->

A [unimodal ODF](RadialODFs_py.html) is a normalized peak around one orientation. Its
[SO(3) kernel](SO3Kernels_py.html) sets the profile of that peak: how the density falls
with angular distance from the centre.

The *halfwidth* is the distance at which a kernel has fallen to half its maximum. It is
a spread parameter, not normally a cutoff. Matching halfwidths aligns one visible
feature, but the tails and peak heights may still differ.

Kernel choice matters when measured orientations are turned into a density; see
[Density Estimation](DensityEstimation_py.html). It also controls how many harmonic
degrees are needed to represent the resulting ODF.
[Series Expansion](SO3FunHarmonicRepresentation_py.html) introduces that representation
and defines its bandwidth.

This page compares kernels for point-centred radial components. Pass an `SO3Kernel`
object to [unimodalODF](unimodalODF.html), or use its `halfwidth` option to select the
default de la Vallee Poussin kernel. A [fibre ODF](FibreODFs_py.html) is different: current
[fibreODF](fibreODF.html) accepts an `S2Kernel` because its density decays across a
curve rather than from one orientation.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

```python
psi = [SO3AbelPoissonKernel(0.79), SO3DeLaValleePoussinKernel(13), SO3BumpKernel(35 * degree), SO3DirichletKernel(3),
       SO3vonMisesFisherKernel(7.5), SO3GaussWeierstrassKernel(0.07), fibreVonMisesFisherKernel(7.2), SO3SquareSingularityKernel(0.72)]

kernelName = ['Abel-Poisson', 'de la Vallee Poussin', 'bump', 'Dirichlet', 'von Mises-Fisher', 'Gauss-Weierstrass',
              'fibre von Mises-Fisher', 'square singularity']
```

## Comparing Halfwidths

The positional arguments above are the native parameters of the eight families. The
labelled output converts them to the common halfwidth scale. The values were chosen to
span the comparable range from about $$15^\circ$$ to $$37^\circ$$. The plots below
therefore show the difference in *shape* rather than in width.

```python
halfwidthInDegree = [kernel.halfwidth() / degree for kernel in psi]
for name, hw in zip(kernelName, halfwidthInDegree):
  print(f'{name:24s} {hw:8.4f}')
```

square singularity        14.8951
```

## Profiles in Orientation Space

Plot each kernel against angular distance from its centre. Every kernel is normalized
to mean 1 on orientation space, not to have maximum 1. Narrower profiles can therefore
have higher peaks.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4.5), layout='constrained')
hold(True)
for kernel, name in zip(psi, kernelName):
  plot(kernel, DisplayName=name)
hold(False)
plt.xlabel('angle from centre in degree')
plt.ylabel('kernel value')
plt.legend(loc='center left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5))
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/ODFShapes-6.png"></center>

The bump kernel is constant inside its halfwidth and exactly zero outside it. This
special cutoff should not be inferred from the meaning of halfwidth in the other
families. The Dirichlet kernel oscillates through zero, whereas the smooth families
decay with different tails.

A negative kernel is useful for some harmonic calculations, but it is not a probability
density. A radial ODF made directly from the Dirichlet kernel can therefore take
negative values. The labelled output confirms that this example does.

```python
omega = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 1000)
dirichletMinimum = np.min(psi[3].eval(np.cos(omega / 2)))
dirichletMinimum
```

## Projected Profiles in a Pole Figure

A pole figure is the crystallographic Radon transform of an ODF; see
[Pole Figures of an ODF](ODFPoleFigure_py.html). Applying that transform to a kernel gives
the profile contributed by one radial component to a pole figure peak. This is the
curve a measured pole figure peak is compared against.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4.5), layout='constrained')
hold(True)
for kernel, name in zip(psi, kernelName):
  plot(kernel.radon(), symmetric=True, DisplayName=name, linewidth=2)
hold(False)
plt.ylim(-5, 20)
plt.xlabel('angular distance in degree')
plt.ylabel('projected kernel value')
plt.legend(loc='center left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5))
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/ODFShapes-8.png"></center>

Projection changes the profiles but does not erase their main distinctions. The bump
remains compactly supported, and the Dirichlet curve retains negative side lobes. The
other curves stay nonnegative but differ in how broadly their pole-figure intensity is
spread.

## Harmonic Cost

A radial kernel stores one coefficient for every harmonic degree from zero through its
bandwidth. Faster coefficient decay permits a lower bandwidth and makes harmonic
computations cheaper.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(7, 4.5), layout='constrained')
hold(True)
for kernel, name in zip(psi, kernelName):
  plotSpektra(kernel, bandwidth=32, linewidth=2, DisplayName=name)
hold(False)
plt.xlabel('harmonic degree')
plt.ylabel('radial coefficient')
plt.legend(loc='center left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5))
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/ODFShapes-9.png"></center>

The plot shows only degrees 0 through 32 so that the low-degree decay can be compared.
The table reports the full stored bandwidth of each kernel. Bandwidth 10 means degrees
0 through 10 and therefore 11 stored radial coefficients, not 10.

```python
kernelBandwidth = [kernel.bandwidth for kernel in psi]
for name, bw in zip(kernelName, kernelBandwidth):
  print(f'{name:24s} {bw:5d}')
```

```text
Abel-Poisson                16
de la Vallee Poussin        10
bump                      1024
Dirichlet                    3
von Mises-Fisher            11
Gauss-Weierstrass           11
fibre von Mises-Fisher      11
square singularity          18
```

The de la Vallee Poussin kernel ends at bandwidth 10. Both von Mises-Fisher variants
and the Gauss-Weierstrass kernel end at 11, whereas the discontinuous bump kernel
continues to bandwidth 1024. A sharp edge is expensive in a smooth harmonic basis.

This combination of a finite exact expansion, nonnegative values, and smooth real-space
shape is why MTEX uses the de la Vallee Poussin family by default for unimodal ODFs and
orientation density estimation.

## Next

Build point-centred peaks in [Radial ODFs](RadialODFs_py.html) and tubular components in
[Fibre ODFs](FibreODFs_py.html). The formulas and constructor details for every family are
collected in [SO(3) Kernels](SO3Kernels_py.html).

## Technical Details

MATLAB's tables are printed rows here, and its figure commands are matplotlib's:
`figure('position', ...)` is `plt.figure(figsize=...)`, `legend` is `plt.legend`. The
halfwidth is the method `kernel.halfwidth()`, the bandwidth the property
`kernel.bandwidth`. The port cuts the bump kernel at the bandwidth its halfwidth
needs rather than at 1024, so that number differs.
