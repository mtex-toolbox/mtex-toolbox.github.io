<!--introduction-->

A fibre is a one-dimensional path through rotation space. A fibre segment joins two
orientations along their shortest angular path. A full fibre contains every orientation
that maps one fixed crystal direction onto one fixed specimen direction while leaving the
rotation about it free.

This page assumes the rotation operations introduced in
[Calculating with Rotations](RotationOperations_py.html) and the interpretation of an
orientation as a map between reference frames from
[Defining Crystal Orientations](OrientationDefinition_py.html). Crystal symmetry and
equivalent orientation descriptions are introduced in
[Orientation Symmetry](OrientationSymmetry_py.html).

The plotting convention controls how the specimen frame is laid out on screen. This page
uses y north and x east.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

```python
# use two reproducible cubic texture components
cs = crystalFrame('432')
oriA = orientation.goss(cs)
oriB = orientation.brass(cs)
```

```python
# select the equivalent of oriB nearest to oriA
oriB = oriB.projectIntoFundamentalRegion(oriA)
```

```python
# construct the shortest segment between the two representatives
f = fibre(oriA, oriB)
f
```

```text
fibre (432 → y↑→x)
  h || r : [011] || (0,0,1)
  o1 → o2: (0°,45°,0°) → (35°,45°,0°)
```

## Reading the Fibre

The displayed endpoint row identifies the finite segment. The row containing `h` and `r`
gives the crystal and specimen directions that remain aligned along it. The two
directions live in different reference frames.

The projection above changes only the symmetry-equivalent representative of `oriB`. It
does not change the physical crystal orientation. Choosing the nearest representative
makes this endpoint segment the shortest one.

## Plotting the Endpoint Segment

The default three-dimensional plot uses Bunge Euler coordinates.

```python
plot(f, lineWidth=3, lineColor='red')
hold(True)
plot(oriA, 'filled', markerSize=20, markerFaceColor='darkred')
plot(oriB, 'filled', markerSize=20, markerFaceColor='blue')
plt.xlim(0, 90)
hold(False)
```

## Reading the Endpoint Plot

The red segment joins the dark-red Goss endpoint at $$(0,45,0)$$ degrees to the blue Brass
endpoint at $$(35,45,0)$$ degrees. Only the first Euler angle changes in this example, so
the segment looks straight. In general, angular distance is not Euclidean distance in an
Euler coordinate plot.

## The Two Directions That Define a Fibre

An orientation maps a direction from the crystal frame into the specimen frame. Every
orientation `ori` on the full fibre satisfies

$$ \mathtt{ori} * h = r. $$

The endpoint constructor has already computed these directions. They are available as
the `h` and `r` properties of [fibre](fibre.fibre.html).

```python
h = f.h
h
```

```text
vector3d (432)
  u       v       w
  0  0.7071  0.7071
```

---

```python
r = f.r
r
```

```text
vector3d (y↑→x)
  x  y  z
  0  0  1
```

Both endpoints map `h` exactly onto `r`. The two displayed entries are their mapping
errors in degrees.

```python
mappingErrorDegrees = np.array([angle(oriA * h, r), angle(oriB * h, r)]) / degree
mappingErrorDegrees
```

```text
array([0., 0.])
```

## A Full Fibre

The option `full=True` discards the finite endpoint and continues the curve through
every rotation about the aligned direction.

```python
fullFibre = fibre(oriA, oriB, full=True)
fullFibre
```

```text
fibre (432 → y↑→x)
  h || r: [011] || (0,0,1)
```

A crystal--specimen direction pair constructs the same full fibre directly. The
displayed logical value confirms that the two definitions agree.

```python
directionFibre = fibre(h, r)
sameFullFibre = fullFibre == directionFibre
sameFullFibre
```

```text
True
```

## Symmetry Can Split the Plot

By default, an orientation plot is folded into a fundamental region.

```python
plot(fullFibre, 'axisAngle', lineWidth=3, lineColor='red')
plt.gca().set_axis_off()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/RotationFibre-13.png"></center>

## Reading the Symmetry-Reduced Plot

The red fibre appears as disconnected arcs because it leaves the chosen fundamental
region and re-enters through a symmetry-equivalent face. These arcs belong to one fibre,
not to several different fibres.

## The Complete Axis--Angle Domain

The option `'complete'` removes the reduction by crystal symmetry.

```python
plot(fullFibre, 'axisAngle', 'complete', lineWidth=3, lineColor='red')
plt.gca().set_axis_off()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/RotationFibre-14.png"></center>

## Reading the Complete Plot

The complete axis--angle ball exposes more of the red curve without the cubic
fundamental-region faces. It still has a coordinate seam: opposite points on the outer
sphere describe the same half turn. A curve cut at that seam is therefore still one
closed fibre in rotation space.

## Sampling a Fibre

[orientation](fibre.orientation.html) discretises a fibre for plotting or numerical
calculations. Specify the number of samples when it matters.

```python
sampledOri = orientation(f, points=12)
numberOfSamples = len(sampledOri)
numberOfSamples
```

```text
12
```

The markers show the 12 sampled orientations on the finite endpoint segment. The
continuous red curve remains the underlying fibre.

```python
plot(f, lineWidth=2, lineColor='red')
plt.xlim(0, 90)
hold(True)
plot(sampledOri, markerSize=8, markerEdgeColor='darkblue', lineWidth=2)
hold(False)
```

## Why a Full Fibre Is a Circle

Unit quaternions represent rotations with the identification $$q=-q$$. Starting from a
quaternion $$q_0$$, a spin through the angle $$\omega$$ about the aligned direction traces

$$ q(\omega)=\left(\cos\frac{\omega}{2}, \sin\frac{\omega}{2}\,\mathbf{n}\right)q_0. $$

As $$\omega$$ runs from 0 to $$2\pi$$, this path follows half of a great circle on the unit
3-sphere from $$q_0$$ to $$-q_0$$. Those endpoints represent the same rotation, so their
projection into rotation space is a closed circle. The finite fibre constructed first is
one subarc of this circle.

## Where Fibres Reappear in MTEX

[angle](fibre.angle.html) measures the distance from an orientation to a fibre.
[Fibres of Orientations](OrientationFibre_py.html) develops pole-figure and
inverse-pole-figure plots, symmetrisation, and named rolling-texture fibres.
[Fibre ODFs](FibreODFs_py.html) spreads a density around a fibre.

Pole-figure values integrate an ODF over fibres. This integration is the
crystallographic Radon transform developed in the
[pole figure tutorial](PoleFigureTutorial_py.html).

plotting and named texture fibres, then [Fibre ODFs](FibreODFs_py.html) for density models
around them.

## Technical Details

A fibre stores its two orientations and the aligned direction; `h`, `r` and the arc are
derived. `full=True` is MATLAB's `'full'` flag, `orientation(f, points=12)` samples it.
