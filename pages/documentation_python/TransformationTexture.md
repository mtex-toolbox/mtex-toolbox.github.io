<!--introduction-->

Parent grain reconstruction asks which parent produced measured children. This page asks the
forward question: which child texture does a known parent texture and parent-to-child
orientation relationship (OR) predict?

The example first transforms one orientation and then an entire orientation distribution
function (ODF). It ends by showing why variant selection must be stated when a predicted
texture is compared with a measured one.

```python
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
```

## Define the parent and child phases

During a phase transformation or twinning, a crystal can rapidly change from a parent
orientation `oriA` to a child orientation `oriB`. An OR describes the fixed angular relation
between their lattices. Here both phases are cubic, and the Nishiyama-Wassermann (NW) OR
relates austenite to ferrite.

```python
csP = crystalFrame('432', mineral='Austenite')
csC = crystalFrame('432', mineral='Ferrite')
p2c = orientation.NishiyamaWassermann(csP, csC)
p2c
```

```text
misorientation (Austenite → Ferrite)
  (111) || (011)   [1̅10] || [100]
```

## Transform one parent orientation

Start with an arbitrary austenite orientation.

```python
oriA = orientation.rand(csP, rng=rng)
oriA
```

```text
orientation (Austenite → y↑→x)
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1   Phi  phi2
   274  25.7   322
```

Symmetry means that the OR does not predict only one ferrite orientation.
[Parent and Child Variants](ParentChildVariants_py.html) defines a variant and derives how
[`variants`](orientation.variants.html) removes equivalent candidates. Applying it here
returns all distinct NW child variants.

```python
oriB = variants(p2c, oriA)
numChildVariants = oriB.size
numChildVariants
```

```text
12
```

The printed result is 12 ferrite variants for this parent orientation. The pole figures show
their crystallographic spread.

```python
hC = Miller([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]], csC)
hP = Miller([[1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]], csP)

plotPDF(oriB, hC, MarkerSize=5, markerColor='black', figSize='medium')

opt = dict(MarkerFaceColor='none', MarkerEdgeColor='darkred', lineWidth=3)
for k in (1, 2):
  nextAxis(k)
  hold(True)
  plot(oriA * hP[k - 1].symmetrise(), **opt)
  xlabel(hP[k - 1].char(), color='red')
  hold(False)
gcm().drawNow()
```

Black points are poles of the 12 child variants. Red open markers are symmetry-equivalent
poles of their one parent. The repeated black clusters show that one sharp parent component
produces several symmetrically related child components.

## Define a parent texture

An ODF is a normalized density on orientation space. Density is reported in multiples of a
random distribution (mrd). We place a 5-degree unimodal austenite ODF around `oriA`.

```python
odfA = unimodalODF(oriA, halfwidth=5 * degree)
print(odfA)

plotPDF(odfA, hP, figSize='medium')
mtexColorbar(title='mrd')
```

```text
SO3FunRBF (Austenite → y↑→x)
  unimodal component
    kernel: de la Vallee Poussin, halfwidth 5°
    center: 1 orientation
    weight: 1
    Bunge Euler angles in degree
    phi1   Phi  phi2  weight
     274  25.7   322       1
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/TransformationTexture-6.png"></center>

Each pole-density maximum surrounds a pole of the modal parent orientation. The finite
halfwidth represents a parent texture component rather than one perfectly sharp
orientation.

## Approximate the child texture by sampling

A Monte Carlo route draws parent orientations from `odfA`. Each of the 10,000 draws produces
all 12 equally populated child variants.

```python
n = 10000
oriASim = odfA.discreteSample(n, rng=rng)
oriBSim = variants(p2c, oriASim)
numSimulatedChildren = oriBSim.size
numSimulatedChildren
```

```text
120000
```

The 120,000 child orientations approximate the transformed texture.
[`calcDensity`](calcDensity.html) turns that discrete set back into an ODF.

```python
odfBSim = calcDensity(oriBSim, halfwidth=10 * degree)
print(odfBSim)

plotPDF(odfBSim, hC, 'contourf', figSize='medium')
mtexColorbar(title='mrd')
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (Ferrite → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 25
  mean     : 1
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/TransformationTexture-8.png"></center>

The lobes occupy the same symmetry-related positions as the single-parent variants. Their
finite width comes from the parent ODF, while small contour irregularities come from random
sampling and density estimation.

## Transform the ODF directly

The direct route passes `odfA` to [`variants`](orientation.variants.html). MTEX averages the
parent density over the 12 candidate-parent branches. This calculation therefore assumes
equal population of all child variants.

```python
odfB = variants(p2c, odfA)
print(odfB)

plotPDF(odfB, hC, 'contourf', figSize='medium')
mtexColorbar(title='mrd')
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (Ferrite → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 48
  mean     : 1
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/TransformationTexture-9.png"></center>

The direct ODF has smooth, sharp lobes at the locations predicted by the discrete
calculation. It avoids Monte Carlo noise and the additional density-estimation step, so it
is the preferred route when equal variant populations are appropriate.

## Quantify the sampling difference

The texture index, or J-index, is the mean square of a normalized ODF. It is 1 for a uniform
texture and increases as texture sharpens. [ODF Characteristics](ODFCharacteristics_py.html)
develops this measure.

```python
meanSampledChildODF = mean(odfBSim)
meanDirectChildODF = mean(odfB)
textureIndexSampled = norm(odfBSim) ** 2
textureIndexDirect = norm(odfB) ** 2
print(meanSampledChildODF, meanDirectChildODF)
print(textureIndexSampled, textureIndexDirect)
```

```text
1.0000000000000002 1.0000000001483556
3.455212210841727 17.45088855158692
```

Both means print as 1.0000, confirming that the ODFs are normalized. The sampled and direct
texture indices are 3.4814 and 17.4509. The earlier page described it as sharper and more
detailed; the two texture-index values make that comparison reproducible. `calcDensity`
selected bandwidth 25, while the direct result retains bandwidth 48. The difference
therefore includes smoothing as well as Monte Carlo noise; it does not compare two
different physical materials.

## Model complete variant selection

Equal populations are a crystallographic baseline, not a universal material law. Stress,
interfaces, and transformation history can favour some variants. To expose the consequence,
assign variant 1 to every sampled parent. This complete selection is deliberately an end
member rather than a fitted physical model.

```python
selectedVariantId = np.ones(n, dtype=int)
oriBSelected = variants(p2c, oriASim, selectedVariantId)
odfBSelected = calcDensity(oriBSelected, halfwidth=10 * degree)
print(odfBSelected)

plotPDF(odfBSelected, hC, 'contourf', figSize='medium')
mtexColorbar(title='mrd')
```

```text
SO3FunHarmonic (Ferrite → y↑→x)
  bandwidth: 25
  mean     : 1
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/TransformationTexture-11.png"></center>

The selected texture contains one transformed branch instead of the 12-branch
superposition. Its stronger, less symmetrically repeated lobes show why measured child
textures cannot be interpreted from the OR alone. A variant-population model is also
required.
