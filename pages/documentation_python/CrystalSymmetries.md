<!--introduction-->

A crystal point group is the set of symmetry operations that leave the crystal structure
indistinguishable while keeping one point fixed. Its operations form a group: applying
any two in succession gives another operation from the same set.

The lattice metric may permit more operations than the arrangement of atoms does. The
symmetry declared for a phase must therefore describe the phase, not merely the shape of
its unit cell.

In MTEX, a symmetry is the point group under which crystal data are invariant. It is
attached to a *crystal frame*, but is not itself that frame. The crystal frame is the
Cartesian reference frame glued to the lattice basis. This distinction matters when the
same abstract symmetry type is used with different axis alignments.

Symmetry also makes one physical orientation equivalent to several rotations. This
equivalence controls fundamental regions, direction families, and misorientation angles
throughout MTEX.

Crystallography distinguishes 230 space-group types, 32 crystallographic point-group
types, and 11 Laue classes. This page starts with point groups and then shows what MTEX
retains from a space group.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

## The 11 Proper-Rotation Groups

A [proper rotation](RotationImproper_py.html) preserves handedness.

The 11 crystallographic point-group types containing only proper rotations are 1, 2,
222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, and 432. They are also called the enantiomorphic point
groups.

[crystalFrame](crystalFrame.crystalFrame.html) accepts either a Hermann--Mauguin symbol

```python
cs = crystalFrame('432')
```

or its Schoenflies equivalent. The comparison confirms that both symbols construct the
same point-group type.

```python
csSchoenflies = crystalFrame('O')
cs.id == csSchoenflies.id
```

```text
True
```

A symmetry-element plot makes the operations visible.

```python
plot(cs)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CrystalSymmetries-5.png"></center>

The number of corners in a solid symbol gives the order of its proper rotation axis.
The plot of 432 shows three fourfold axes along the crystal axes, four threefold axes
along cube body diagonals, and six twofold axes. The rotations about these axes,
together with the identity, give 24 operations.

## Laue Groups

Adding [rotation.inversion](rotation.inversion.html) to a proper-rotation group gives
its Laue group. union performs that construction here.

```python
csLaue = union(cs, rotation.inversion)
```

```python
plot(csLaue)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CrystalSymmetries-7.png"></center>

The hollow circle at the centre is the inversion. The result is also available from the
[Laue](symmetry.Laue.html) method. Its summary shows that 432 has become $$m\bar{3}m$$
with 48 operations.

```python
cs.Laue()
```

```text
crystalFrame (⊙c→a)
  symmetry: m3̅m
  elements: 48
  a, b, c : 1, 1, 1
```

Every Laue group is obtained this way from one of the 11 proper-rotation groups. Its
order is twice that of the proper group because every rotation occurs once without
inversion and once with inversion.

The operation tables make the doubling explicit for 222.

```python
cs = crystalFrame('222')
rotation(cs)
```

```text
rotation
  size: 4
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1  Phi  phi2
     0    0     0
    45  180    45
   135  180   315
   180    0     0
```

---

```python
orthogonalTransform(cs.Laue())
```

```text
orthogonalTransform
  size: 8
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1  Phi  phi2  Inv.
     0    0     0     0
    45  180    45     0
   135  180   315     0
   180    0     0     0
     0    0     0     1
    45  180    45     1
   135  180   315     1
   180    0     0     1
```

The first table contains four proper operations. The second contains those four
followed by four operations carrying the `Inv.` flag. Laue symmetry is the apparent
symmetry of diffraction intensities when Friedel's law applies. Resonant scattering can
break that equivalence. See [Axes and Antipodal Symmetry](VectorsAxes_py.html) for the
corresponding treatment of opposite directions.

## Mixed Point Groups

The remaining point groups contain improper operations but do not contain inversion
itself. The group mm2 is an example.

```python
cs = crystalFrame('mm2')
orthogonalTransform(cs)
```

```text
orthogonalTransform
  size: 4
  Bunge Euler angles in degree
  phi1  Phi  phi2  Inv.
     0    0     0     0
    45  180    45     1
   135  180   315     1
   180    0     0     0
```

---

```python
plot(cs)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CrystalSymmetries-12.png"></center>

The table contains two proper and two improper operations. In the plot, great circles
mark the two mirror planes and the solid lens marks the twofold axis. A hollow polygon
would mark an improper rotation axis.

The 10 mixed point-group types are m, mm2, 3m, -4, 4mm, -42m, -6, 6mm, -6m2, and -43m.
Together with the 11 proper-rotation groups and 11 Laue groups, they make the 32
crystallographic point-group types.

## Proper Group and Proper Subgroup

A mixed group has two useful associated groups, and their names are easy to confuse.
Consider -4m2.

```python
cs = crystalFrame('-4m2')
```

[properGroup](symmetry.properGroup.html) replaces every improper operation by the proper
rotation with the same stored axis and angle. The result is 422 with eight operations.

```python
properGroup = cs.properGroup()
properGroup
```

```text
crystalFrame (⊙c→a)
  symmetry: 422
  elements: 8
  a, b, c : 1, 1, 1
```

[properSubGroup](symmetry.properSubGroup.html) instead retains only the operations of
the original group that are proper. The result is 222 with four operations.

```python
properSubGroup = cs.properSubGroup()
properSubGroup
```

```text
crystalFrame (⊙c→a)
  symmetry: 222
  elements: 4
  a, b, c : 1, 1, 1
```

The four plots compare the original point group with both proper groups and its Laue
group.

```python
mtexFigure(layout=[2, 2])
plot(cs)
plt.gca().text(0.03, 0.97, '-4m2', transform=plt.gca().transAxes, va='top')

nextAxis()
plot(properGroup)
plt.gca().text(0.03, 0.97, '422', transform=plt.gca().transAxes, va='top')

nextAxis()
plot(properSubGroup)
plt.gca().text(0.03, 0.97, '222', transform=plt.gca().transAxes, va='top')

nextAxis()
plot(cs.Laue())
plt.gca().text(0.03, 0.97, '4/mmm', transform=plt.gca().transAxes, va='top')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CrystalSymmetries-16.png"></center>

The upper-left plot contains the actual operations of -4m2. The upper-right plot is its
eight-operation proper group, 422. That group is not a subgroup of -4m2. The lower-left
plot is its four-operation proper subgroup, 222. The lower-right plot is the
16-operation Laue group, 4/mmm.

## Alignment of the Symmetry Operations

A point-group type specifies which operations exist, but their alignment belongs to the
crystal frame. The following plots show the same abstract group with its twofold axis
aligned with a different crystal axis. The a-axis points east in every panel.

```python
mtexFigure(layout=[1, 3])
cs = crystalFrame('2mm')
plot(cs)
plt.gca().text(0.03, 0.97, '2mm', transform=plt.gca().transAxes, va='top')
annotate(cs.aAxis, labeled=True)

nextAxis()
cs = crystalFrame('m2m')
plot(cs)
plt.gca().text(0.03, 0.97, 'm2m', transform=plt.gca().transAxes, va='top')
annotate(cs.aAxis, labeled=True)

nextAxis()
cs = crystalFrame('mm2')
plot(cs)
plt.gca().text(0.03, 0.97, 'mm2', transform=plt.gca().transAxes, va='top')
annotate(cs.aAxis, labeled=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CrystalSymmetries-17.png"></center>

The twofold axis lies along a in the first panel, b in the second, and c in the third.
Similar alternatives occur for 112, 121, 211, 11m, 1m1, m11, 321, 312, 3m1, and 31m.
Choosing the wrong alignment changes how every Miller index and orientation is
interpreted. See [Reference System](CrystalReferenceSystem_py.html) for the role of the
crystal frame and [Crystal Axes Alignment](SymmetryAlignment_py.html) for changing between
conventions.

## Space Groups

A space group also includes translations and operations with translational parts, such
as screw rotations and glide reflections. MTEX accepts a Hermann--Mauguin space-group
symbol. A number is passed through the `spaceId` option. In either case, `crystalFrame`
stores only the corresponding point group.

```python
cs = crystalFrame('Fm-3m')
cs
```

```text
crystalFrame (⊙c→a)
  symmetry: m3̅m
  elements: 48
  a, b, c : 1, 1, 1
```

---

```python
plot(cs)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CrystalSymmetries-19.png"></center>

The summary identifies $$m\bar{3}m$$ with 48 operations. The plot likewise contains only
point-group symmetry elements. It cannot show the face centring or any translational
part of $$Fm\bar{3}m$$.

## Computing with Symmetries

union combines compatible symmetry operations, while
disjoint retains the operations common to two
symmetries.

```python
combined = union(crystalFrame('23'), crystalFrame('4'))
combined
```

```text
crystalFrame (⊙c→a)
  symmetry: 432
  elements: 24
  a, b, c : 1, 1, 1
```

The operations of 23 together with the fourfold axis of 4 generate the 24 operations of
432.

```python
common = disjoint(crystalFrame('432'), crystalFrame('622'))
common
```

```text
crystalFrame (⊙c→a)
  symmetry: 222
  elements: 4
  a, b, c : 1, 1, 1
```

Cubic 432 and hexagonal 622 have the identity and three twofold rotations in common.
Those four operations form 222.

## Import from CIF and PHL Files

crystalFrame.load reads the point group, lattice parameters,
and phase name from a crystallographic information file. With no extension, MTEX
searches its CIF data path.

```python
csQuartz = crystalFrame.load('quartz')
csQuartz
```

```text
crystalFrame (⊙c→a)
  mineral        : Quartz
  symmetry       : 321
  elements       : 6
  a, b, c        : 4.916, 4.916, 5.405
  reference frame: X||a*, Y||b, Z||c
```

A Bruker `.phl` file may contain several phases, so the result is a list of crystal
symmetries. The first entry in the bundled example is magnetite.

```python
csList = crystalFrame.load('crystal.phl')
csList[0]
```

```text
crystalFrame (⊙c→a)
  mineral : Magnetite
  color   : (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
  symmetry: m3̅m
  elements: 48
  a, b, c : 8.431, 8.431, 8.431
```

## Next

[Miller Indices](CrystalDirections_py.html) introduces directions and planes in the
crystal frame. [Operations](CrystalOperations_py.html) then applies the symmetries defined
here to those directions, and [Fundamental Sector](FundamentalSector_py.html) selects one
representative from each equivalent family. A rotation together with crystal and
specimen symmetry becomes an [orientation](OrientationDefinition_py.html).

## Technical Details

A `rotation` is proper here, so the operations of a group with improper elements are
listed by `orthogonalTransform(cs)`, MATLAB's `rotation(cs)`; `rotation(cs)` works for
a proper group. `Laue`, `properGroup` and `properSubGroup` are methods with parentheses.
The point group is built from its Hermann-Mauguin symbol in closure order and a group in
a setting no symbol spells, the proper subgroup of -4m2, is named by its type.
