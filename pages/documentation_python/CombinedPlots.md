<!--introduction-->

Many scientific figures put related information together. Examples include
measurements over a fitted function, two data sets in one projection, or
crystal directions on an inverse pole figure.

MTEX offers three ways to combine plots. The right choice depends on
whether the figure has one axis, several managed axes, or independent
panels.

This page assumes the plot types from [Plot Types](PlotTypes_py.html) and the
screen frame from [Axes Alignment](AxesAlignment_py.html). The examples also
use pole figures, inverse pole figures, and three-dimensional orientation
plots. Follow the links where each first appears if these are unfamiliar.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Holding a Plot

The MATLAB way is `hold on`, here `hold(True)`. It keeps what is drawn,
so the next command adds to it rather than replacing it. The command
`hold(False)` ends that state.

```python
plt.close('all')
plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 2], linewidth=2)

hold(True)

plt.plot([1, 2], [1, 3], linewidth=2)

hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CombinedPlots-2.png"></center>

The sloping line is added without erasing the horizontal one. After
`hold(False)`, the next high-level plotting command may replace both.

## Two Data Sets in One Projection

Start with a compact set of orientations and rotate a copy of its parent
distribution.

```python
cs = crystalFrame('-3m')
odf = unimodalODF(orientation.byEuler(0, 0, 0, cs))
ori = discreteSample(odf, 100)
oriRotated = discreteSample(rotate(odf, rotation.byEuler(60 * degree, 60 * degree, 0 * degree)), 100)
```

Draw both sets in axis--angle space. Each orientation becomes a point whose
direction is its rotation axis. Its distance from the origin is the
rotation angle. See [3D Orientation Visualizations](OrientationVisualization3d_py.html)
for this representation.

```python
scatter(ori, 'axisAngle')
hold(True)   # keep plot
scatter(oriRotated)
hold(False)  # next plot command deletes all plots
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CombinedPlots-4.png"></center>

The figure holds three clouds. The original set is a single compact blob
near the origin. The rotated set is one cluster too, but it appears as two
lobes in opposite corners of the region: once a cluster sits far from the
identity, its symmetrically equivalent representatives no longer all fall
in the same corner.

Either way the rotated points occupy different ground from the original
ones, which shows that the rotation changed the orientations rather than
only their plotted description.

## The Same Data in Pole Figures

Project the same comparison along two crystal directions. The second
`plotPF` does not repeat the `antipodal` flag. The existing axes already
define that symmetry. Added data must conform to those axes.

```python
h = [Miller(0, 0, 0, 1, cs), Miller(1, 0, -1, 0, cs)]
plotPF(ori, h, antipodal=True, markerSize=4)
hold(True)
plotPF(oriRotated, h, markerSize=4)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CombinedPlots-5.png"></center>

Both pole-figure panels contain the two orientation sets. Here `plotPF`
sees the two crystal directions. It adds the second set to both matching
axes. That multi-axis behaviour belongs to `plotPF`, not to `hold` itself.

## Adding to Every Axis at Once

`hold(True)` changes only the *current* axis. A pole-figure figure has one axis
per crystal direction. The general way to add one data set to every MTEX
axis is the `add2all` flag.

```python
plotPF(odf, h, antipodal=True, contourf=True, grid=True)
mtexColorMap('white2black')

plot(ori, displayName='original', markerSize=5, markerFaceColor='b', markerEdgeColor='w', add2all=True)

plot(oriRotated, displayName='rotated', markerSize=5, markerFaceColor='r', markerEdgeColor='k', add2all=True)

legend('show', location='northeast')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CombinedPlots-6.png"></center>

Each orientation set appears in both pole figures after one command. MTEX
reprojects the orientations according to the crystal direction stored on
each axis. Plain `hold(True)` neither selects all axes nor performs that
dispatch.

ODF sections work the same way, and here it matters more: there are eight
axes, and every orientation belongs in the section closest to it.

```python
plotSection(odf, 'sigma', sections=8, contourf=True)
mtexColorMap('white2black')
plot(ori, markerSize=6, markerFaceColor='b', markerEdgeColor='w', add2all=True)
plot(oriRotated, markerSize=6, markerFaceColor='r', markerEdgeColor='k', add2all=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CombinedPlots-7.png"></center>

Both sets place markers in every section, so the section a marker lands in
does not by itself separate the two. What distinguishes them is where they
sit within a section: the original markers follow the contours of the ODF,
and the rotated ones do not.

## Marking Crystal Directions

An inverse pole figure fixes a specimen direction and maps the crystal
directions parallel to it. See [Inverse Pole Figures](ODFInversePoleFigure_py.html)
for the construction. Marking important crystal directions makes
the plot readable.
The `symmetrised` flag draws every symmetrically equivalent direction,
while `labeled` writes the indices beside them.

```python
plotIPF(odf, xvector, axisLabels=False)
mtexColorMap('white2black')

hold(True)   # keep plot
plot(Miller(0, 0, 0, 1, cs), symmetrised=True, labeled=True, backgroundColor='w')
plot(Miller(1, 1, -2, 0, cs), symmetrised=True, labeled=True, backgroundColor='w')
plot(Miller(0, 1, -1, 0, cs), symmetrised=True, labeled=True, backgroundColor='w')
plot(Miller(0, 1, -1, 1, cs), symmetrised=True, labeled=True, backgroundColor='w')
hold(False)  # next plot command deletes all plots
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CombinedPlots-8.png"></center>

The labels expose an important correction: the maximum is not at (0001).
This ODF is centred on the identity orientation, so specimen X corresponds
to a crystal direction in the basal plane. A c-axis maximum would instead
appear in the inverse pole figure for specimen Z.

## Different Plots Side by Side

The third case arranges several independent plots rather than overlaying
them. The MTEX commands used below accept a `parent` axes, so matplotlib's
own `subplot` can do the arranging.

```python
pf = mtexdata('dubna')
```

---

```python
odf = calcODF(pf, verbose=False)
```

A measured, a recalculated, and a difference pole figure form the standard
comparison for judging a reconstruction. See
[ODF Estimation](PoleFigure2ODF_py.html) for the reconstruction workflow.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))

# set position 1 in a 1x3 matrix as the current plotting position
axesPos = plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)

# plot pole figure 1 at this position
plot(pf[0], parent=axesPos)

# set position 2 in a 1x3 matrix as the current plotting position
axesPos = plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)

# plot the recalculated pole figure at this position
plotPF(odf, pf.allH[0], antipodal=True, parent=axesPos)

# set position 3 in a 1x3 matrix as the current plotting position
axesPos = plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)

# plot the difference pole figure at this position
plotDiff(odf, pf[0], parent=axesPos)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CombinedPlots-11.png"></center>

From left to right, the panels show the measured intensity, the smoother
intensity recalculated from the ODF, and their relative difference. The
last panel locates mismatches that the first two panels make hard to judge.
Compare colour values only when the relevant panels use the same range.

[Multiplot](Multiplot_py.html). It keeps axes aligned and can share one
colorbar and one colour range across the figure.
