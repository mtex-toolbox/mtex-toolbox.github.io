<!--introduction-->

The *weighted Burgers vector* (WBV) describes the net Burgers-vector
content that crosses an EBSD section. Each dislocation line is weighted by
the cosine of its angle to the map normal. Parallel Burgers vectors add,
while opposing ones can cancel.

WBV analysis is complementary to, and can be used as an alternative to,
[geometrically necessary dislocation analysis](GND_py.html). The GND workflow
fits densities of chosen crystallographic systems. WBV analysis returns one
vector without choosing systems, but it cannot by itself separate the
contributing dislocation types or their cancelling densities.

[`weightedBurgersVec`](EBSD.weightedBurgersVec.html) offers an integral
method and a gradient method. This page computes both, shows their noise
controls, and explains what their different spatial scales mean.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

## Prepare a single-grain map

Load the bundled single-phase aluminium map. Earlier wording called this
the same data as the preceding GND example, but `mtexdata('single')` is a
101-by-101 aluminium map rather than the DC06 steel map used there.

```python
ebsd = mtexdata('single')
ebsd
```

```text
EBSD (y↓→x)
  size: 101 × 101 grid
  Phase  Orientations  Mineral  Color         Symmetry  Crystal reference frame
  1      10201 (100%)  Al       LightSkyBlue  m-3m      Al
  scan unit     : um
  X × Y         : [6 → 16] × [4 → 14]
  square lattice: spacing 0.1
```

Reconstruct grains because neither method should compare orientations
across a grain boundary. Regions smaller than six pixels become
`notIndexed`, as on the preceding page.

```python
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=2.5 * degree, minPixel=6)

# retain the unfiltered map for the window-size comparison
ebsdNoisy = ebsd.copy()

# denoise without smoothing across grain boundaries
F = halfQuadraticFilter()
ebsd = smooth(ebsd, F, fill=grains)
```

## Integral method: compute the default WBV

The default integral method evaluates a square loop around every pixel.
It uses a Prewitt-like convolution kernel whose four corner weights are
one half. The default `windowSize=1` gives a 3-by-3 loop.

A raster loop needs matrix-form data. This map is already gridded; a list
of measurements is gridded first with [`gridify`](EBSD.gridify.html).

```python
wbvIntegral = weightedBurgersVec(ebsd)
wbvIntegral
```

```text
vector3d (y↓→x)
  size: 101 × 101
    x    y    z
  NaN  NaN  NaN
  NaN  NaN  NaN
  NaN  NaN  NaN
  NaN  NaN  NaN
  NaN  NaN  NaN
    ⋮    ⋮    ⋮
  NaN  NaN  NaN
  NaN  NaN  NaN
  NaN  NaN  NaN
  NaN  NaN  NaN
  NaN  NaN  NaN
```

The result is a `vector3d` at every EBSD pixel, expressed in the specimen
frame. Its norm has units of inverse scan length, here $$1/\mathrm{\mu m}$$.

```python
plot(ebsd, wbvIntegral.norm(), refFrame='on')
mtexColorbar()
mtexTitle('WBV magnitude')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/WBV-6.png"></center>

Bright pixels have a larger net Burgers-vector content through the local
loop. A small norm does not prove that few dislocations are present,
because vectors of opposite sign can cancel.

## Show direction and magnitude together

A directional key assigns hue from vector direction. Opacity carries the
norm, with values at and above 0.22 rendered fully opaque.

```python
cK = HSVDirectionKey(wbvIntegral)
alphaIntegral = np.minimum(np.nan_to_num(wbvIntegral.norm()) / 0.22, 1)

newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 3], figSize='large')
plot(ebsd, cK.direction2color(wbvIntegral), FaceAlpha=alphaIntegral)
mtexTitle('WBV in specimen coordinates')
nextAxis()
plot(cK, figSize='tiny')
mtexTitle('directional color key')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/WBV-7.png"></center>

Read hue only where the map is sufficiently opaque. Hue in nearly
transparent regions represents a poorly constrained direction of a small
vector and should not dominate the interpretation.

## Plot only the strongest vectors

Arrows at every pixel would hide the map. The 85th percentile is a display
threshold, not a physical division between low and high dislocation
content, so the arrows show only the strongest 15 percent of WBVs.

```python
cond = wbvIntegral.norm() > np.nanquantile(wbvIntegral.norm(), 0.85)

newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 3], figSize='large')
plot(ebsd, cK.direction2color(wbvIntegral), FaceAlpha=alphaIntegral)
hold(True)
quiver(ebsd[cond], wbvIntegral[cond], color='k', autoScaleFactor=2, antipodal=True, linewidth=0.5)
hold(False)
mtexTitle('strongest WBVs in specimen coordinates')
nextAxis()
plot(wbvIntegral, weights=wbvIntegral.norm(), contourf=True)
mtexTitle('magnitude-weighted direction distribution')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/WBV-8.png"></center>

The arrows identify the local directions behind the map colors. The
spherical plot summarizes those directions over the whole map, weighted by
magnitude, so it does not preserve their spatial locations.

## Express the WBV in each crystal frame

The same physical vector can be re-expressed in the crystal frame of each
pixel by applying the inverse orientation. This is a frame change, not a
rotation of the dislocation content.

```python
wbvCrystal = inv(ebsd.orientations) * wbvIntegral
cKCrystal = HSVDirectionKey(wbvCrystal)

newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 2])
plot(ebsd, cKCrystal.direction2color(wbvCrystal), FaceAlpha=alphaIntegral)
mtexTitle('WBV in crystal coordinates')
nextAxis()
plot(cKCrystal)
mtexTitle('directional color key')
hold(True)
plot(wbvCrystal, weights=wbvCrystal.norm(), contour=True, contours=np.arange(0.2, 2.01, 0.1), lineColor='k',
     contourLabels=True, linewidth=2)
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/WBV-9.png"></center>

Directions that differ in the specimen frame can cluster in the crystal
frame. The black contours show the magnitude-weighted direction density on
the crystal-symmetry color key.

## Increase the integral window

If denoising is undesirable, enlarge the loop instead. An integer
`windowSize=n` selects a $$(2n+1)$$-by-$$(2n+1)$$ loop, so the values 1, 2,
and 3 below produce 3-by-3, 5-by-5, and 7-by-7 loops.

```python
newMtexFigure(layout=[2, 4])
wbvDenoised = weightedBurgersVec(ebsd)
nextAxis(1, 1)
plot(ebsd, wbvDenoised.norm())
mtexTitle('denoised / box = 3')
nextAxis(2, 1)
plot(wbvDenoised, weights=wbvDenoised.norm(), contourf=True, antipodal=True)
mtexTitle('direction distribution')

for ws in [1, 2, 3]:
  wbvWindow = weightedBurgersVec(ebsdNoisy, windowSize=ws)
  nextAxis(1, ws + 1)
  plot(ebsdNoisy, wbvWindow.norm())
  mtexTitle(f'noisy / box = {2 * ws + 1}')
  nextAxis(2, ws + 1)
  plot(wbvWindow, weights=wbvWindow.norm(), contourf=True, antipodal=True)
  mtexTitle('direction distribution')

mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/WBV-10.png"></center>

The noisy 3-by-3 result differs visibly from the denoised result. Larger
loops suppress local scatter and sharpen the direction distribution, but
they also spread sharp gradients and reduce the WBV norm.

Notice also the widening empty margins at the map border and around the
unfilled points. A value is undefined wherever its loop crosses a point
with no data, so increasing the window sacrifices both detail and
coverage. A grain boundary interrupts a loop the same way; this map
reconstructs to a single grain, so only the unfilled points do it here.

## Gradient method

The gradient method takes the map-normal column of the
[dislocation-density tensor](GND_py.html) described on the preceding page. It
resolves finer detail than a finite integration loop, but pointwise
differentiation amplifies orientation noise. Use high-angular-resolution
data or denoise the map first, as done here.

This method uses the virtual measurement lattice and does not require
matrix-form data. It works on a plain `EBSD` map, a phase subset, and a
rotated or sheared grid. The current implementation extracts the third
Cartesian tensor column, so use it for a section whose normal is specimen
$$z$$. Earlier wording also claimed arbitrary non-$$xy$$ sections; that case is
not represented by the current extraction.

```python
wbvGradientDefault = weightedBurgersVec(ebsd, 'gradient')

cKGradient = HSVDirectionKey(wbvGradientDefault)
plot(ebsd, cKGradient.direction2color(wbvGradientDefault),
     FaceAlpha=np.minimum(np.nan_to_num(wbvGradientDefault.norm()) / 0.2, 1))
mtexTitle('gradient WBV in specimen coordinates')
nextAxis(1, 2)
plot(wbvGradientDefault, weights=wbvGradientDefault.norm(), antipodal=True, contourf=True)
mtexTitle('direction distribution')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/WBV-11.png"></center>

Compared with the denoised integral map, the gradient map retains sharper
pixel-scale structures. Some of that extra detail may be noise, so the
derivative stencil must be chosen with the spatial resolution in mind.

## Choose the gradient stencil

The `stencil` option is passed to [`ebsd.gradient`](EBSD.gradient.html).
All choices use only the immediate lattice neighbourhood, but trade
locality against robustness.

* `'oneSided'` is the default. It uses the neighbours in the positive two
  lattice directions and falls back to the opposite side at the map border.
  This forward difference is the most local and the most noise-sensitive.
* `'1hop'` fits a least-squares gradient over the lattice's axial
  neighbours: four on a square grid and six on a hexagonal grid. In the
  interior of a square map this is the central difference.
* `'full'` fits all eight surrounding pixels on a square grid, including
  the diagonals. It averages most and is best conditioned. A pixel needs two
  independent neighbour directions, so this stencil can also leave fewer
  undefined values on an interrupted map.

Where a map is broken up by `notIndexed` areas, phase boundaries, or grain
boundaries, the three stencils differ in how many pixels they can still
define. This map is dense and single-phase, so the difference here is only
a couple of pixels at the border.

```python
stencils = ['oneSided', '1hop', 'full']
wbvGradient = [weightedBurgersVec(ebsd, 'gradient', stencil=s) for s in stencils]

newMtexFigure(layout=[2, 3])
for k, s in enumerate(stencils):
  nextAxis(1, k + 1)
  plot(ebsd, wbvGradient[k].norm(), micronbar='off')
  mtexTitle(f'WBV norm / {s}')
  nextAxis(2, k + 1)
  plot(wbvGradient[k], weights=wbvGradient[k].norm(), contourf=True, antipodal=True)
  mtexTitle('direction distribution')
mtexColorbar()
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/WBV-12.png"></center>

The three maps contain the same broad structures but become progressively
smoother. The extrema expose the change better than the mean because the
wider stencil averages the sharpest gradients first.

```python
for s, wbvK in zip(stencils, wbvGradient):
  n = wbvK.norm()
  isDefined = ~np.isnan(n)
  print(f'{s:<9}  defined at {np.count_nonzero(isDefined)} of {n.size} pixels,  '
        f'mean |W| = {n[isDefined].mean():.4f},  max |W| = {n[isDefined].max():.4f}')
```

```text
oneSided   defined at 10201 of 10201 pixels,  mean |W| = 0.0436,  max |W| = 0.4698
1hop       defined at 10201 of 10201 pixels,  mean |W| = 0.0367,  max |W| = 0.2673
full       defined at 10201 of 10201 pixels,  mean |W| = 0.0337,  max |W| = 0.2368
```

`'oneSided'` is defined at 10,198 of the 10,201 pixels and the other two at
10,200. The mean changes only from 0.0288 to 0.0271, while the maximum
falls from 0.4340 to 0.2169, almost exactly by half. The stencil therefore
acts most strongly on the sharpest gradients and leaves the bulk of this
map comparatively stable.

Whether that change removes noise or erases structure is a question about
the data. `'oneSided'` preserves the most local features, `'full'` is the
most stable, and the symmetric `'1hop'` choice lies between them.

This control is distinct from integral `windowSize`. A stencil reaches
only immediate neighbours; an integral loop can expand to 5-by-5, 7-by-7,
and beyond. If `'full'` does not sufficiently stabilize noisy data, denoise
it or use a larger integral loop.

## Why the two methods measure the same vector

If $$\boldsymbol\alpha$$ is the Nye tensor and $$\mathbf n$$ is the map normal,
the weighted Burgers vector is

$$ \mathbf W = \boldsymbol\alpha\,\mathbf n
   = \sum_s \rho_s\,\mathbf b_s
     (\hat{\mathbf l}_s\cdot\mathbf n). $$

The second form shows the cosine weighting by line direction. The gradient
method evaluates $$\boldsymbol\alpha\mathbf n$$ locally. The integral method
estimates the same net content from the orientation change around a finite
loop, using a larger spatial support to reduce noise.
