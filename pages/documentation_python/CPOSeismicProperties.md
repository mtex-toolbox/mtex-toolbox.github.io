<!--introduction-->

This page turns an EBSD map into the stiffness tensor and seismic-wave
plots of a polycrystalline aggregate. The required inputs are the phase
proportions, the crystal orientations, one single-crystal stiffness tensor
per phase, and the corresponding densities. The result connects a
crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) to directional wave speeds.

The worked sequence has four steps: place the map in its external reference
frame, define the phase tensors, average them over the measured
orientations, and inspect the aggregate seismic plots.

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('forsterite')
ebsd
```

## Inspect the phases and choose the averaging population

The map contains Forsterite, Enstatite, and Diopside. Its display reports
approximately 62% Forsterite, 11% Enstatite, 3.7% Diopside, and 24%
notIndexed pixels. For an elastic aggregate, the phase proportions must be
normalized over the indexed pixels because no orientation or phase tensor
is available for the notIndexed measurements.

```python
phaseFraction = np.array([len(ebsd['f']), len(ebsd['e']), len(ebsd['d'])]) / len(ebsd['indexed'])

print('Indexed phase fractions: Forsterite %.1f%%, Enstatite %.1f%%, Diopside %.1f%%.' % tuple(100 * phaseFraction))
```

```text
Indexed phase fractions: Forsterite 81.3%, Enstatite 13.9%, Diopside 4.8%.
```

## Place the map in the external reference frame

In the imported map, the foliation runs north--south. Standard geoscience
CPO plots and physical-property plots instead use an external reference
frame with vertical east--west foliation and horizontal east--west
lineation. Rotating the complete dataset by 90 degrees about the
$$z$$-axis moves both its positions and its orientations into that frame.

```python
ebsd = rotation.byAxisAngle(zvector, -90 * degree) * ebsd
```

The next command puts $$x$$ towards north for a better screen fit. It changes
the session-wide plotting convention, so the map, pole figures, and tensor
plots below all use the same screen directions.

```python
plottingConvention.default(north=xvector)
plot(ebsd, refFrame=True)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CPOSeismicProperties-6.png"></center>

The reference-frame arrows are the check on this operation. Read them
before interpreting a fast direction as a geological lineation.

## Define the Forsterite stiffness tensor

Abramson et al. (1997) reported the following olivine stiffness coefficients
in GPa. The crystal symmetry records the lattice parameters and the crystal
reference frame in which those coefficients were measured. The density is
in $$\mathrm{g/cm}^3$$ so that [velocity](stiffnessTensor.velocity.html)
returns km/s.

```python
CS_Tensor_Fo = crystalFrame('222', [4.762, 10.225, 5.994], mineral='Forsterite', color='light red')

rho_Fo = 3.3550

Cij = [[320.5, 68.15, 71.6, 0, 0, 0],
       [68.15, 196.5, 76.8, 0, 0, 0],
       [71.6, 76.8, 233.5, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 64, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 77, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 78.7]]

C_Fo = stiffnessTensor(Cij, CS_Tensor_Fo, density=rho_Fo)
```

A single-crystal tensor must always carry the crystal reference frame used
to express its components $$c_{ijkl}$$. Equal-looking component tables in
different frames do not describe the same directions in the crystal.

## Define the Enstatite stiffness tensor

The phase named Enstatite uses the orthopyroxene coefficients reported by
Chai et al. (1997). The explicit alignment states that $$x$$ is parallel to
the $$a$$-axis and $$z$$ is parallel to the $$c$$-axis.

```python
cs_Tensor_opx = crystalFrame('mmm', [18.2457, 8.7984, 5.1959], np.array([90, 90, 90]) * degree, 'x||a', 'z||c',
                             mineral='Enstatite')

rho_opx = 3.3060

Cij = [[236.90, 79.60, 63.20, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00],
       [79.60, 180.50, 56.80, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00],
       [63.20, 56.80, 230.40, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00],
       [0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 84.30, 0.00, 0.00],
       [0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 79.40, 0.00],
       [0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 80.10]]

C_opx = stiffnessTensor(Cij, cs_Tensor_opx, density=rho_opx)
```

## Define the Diopside stiffness tensor

Isaak et al. published these monoclinic chrome-diopside coefficients online
in 2005. Their table uses $$x$$ parallel to the $$a^{*}$$-axis and $$z$$ parallel
to the $$c$$-axis.

```python
cs_Tensor_cpx = crystalFrame('121', [9.585, 8.776, 5.26], np.array([90, 105.86, 90]) * degree, 'x||a*', 'z||c',
                             mineral='Diopside')

rho_cpx = 3.2860

Cij = [[228.10, 78.80, 70.20, 0.00, 7.90, 0.00],
       [78.80, 181.10, 61.10, 0.00, 5.90, 0.00],
       [70.20, 61.10, 245.40, 0.00, 39.70, 0.00],
       [0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 78.90, 0.00, 6.40],
       [7.90, 5.90, 39.70, 0.00, 68.20, 0.00],
       [0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 6.40, 0.00, 78.10]]

C_cpx = stiffnessTensor(Cij, cs_Tensor_cpx, density=rho_cpx)
```

## Match the tensor and EBSD crystal frames

The published Diopside lattice parameters differ from those of the measured
phase by about 2%. [calcTensor](EBSD.calcTensor.html) matches a phase tensor
by mineral name, Laue group, and lattice parameters. It accepts at most 1%
relative deviation in the lattice axes and 0.01 rad in the lattice angles,
so it deliberately rejects this near match.

The remedy is [transformReferenceFrame](tensor.transformReferenceFrame.html).
A frame change re-expresses the same physical tensor in the crystal frame of
the measured phase; it does not rotate the crystal or change its elastic
response.

```python
C_cpx = transformReferenceFrame(C_cpx, ebsd['Diopside'].CS)
```

Only Diopside needs this explicit frame change. The Forsterite and Enstatite
tensor frames already match their measured phases within the tolerances.

## Read a single-crystal seismic overview

[Wave Velocities](WaveVelocities_py.html) develops the three wave modes and
their polarization directions. Here
[plotSeismicVelocities](stiffnessTensor.plotSeismicVelocities.html)
summarizes the Forsterite result.

```python
plotSeismicVelocities(C_Fo)

# Add crystal-axis labels to the S-wave anisotropy panel.
nextAxis(1, 2)
hold(True)
text(Miller([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]], CS_Tensor_Fo), ['[100]', '[010]', '[001]'], backgroundColor='w')
hold(False)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CPOSeismicProperties-11.png"></center>

Red is slow and blue is fast. In each velocity panel, a black square marks
the maximum and a white circle marks the minimum. The short bars in the
$$V_{s1}$$ and $$V_{s2}$$ panels show shear-wave polarization. The added crystal
axes let you relate these patterns to directions in the Forsterite lattice.

## Average the measured orientations directly

[Tensor Averages](TensorAverage_py.html) explains the Voigt uniform-strain
estimate, the Reuss uniform-stress estimate, and their Hill mean.
`calcTensor` rotates the appropriate phase tensor by every indexed
orientation and returns all three aggregate estimates.

```python
CVoigtEbsd, CReussEbsd, CHillEbsd = calcTensor(ebsd, C_Fo, C_opx, C_cpx, 'all')

plotSeismicVelocities(CHillEbsd)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CPOSeismicProperties-12.png"></center>

This plot is read in the external frame checked above, not in any one
crystal frame. Compare it with the single-crystal plot: averaging weakens
the directional contrast, but the CPO leaves preferred fast and slow
directions. The subtitle of each panel reports its anisotropy.

## Average orientation distributions phase by phase

Direct averaging can be slow for a large EBSD dataset. An alternative is to
estimate one orientation distribution function (ODF) per phase, then
average each phase tensor over its ODF. An ODF describes the volume fraction
of crystals at each orientation.

```python
odf_ol = calcDensity(ebsd['f'].orientations, halfwidth=10 * degree)
odf_opx = calcDensity(ebsd['e'].orientations, halfwidth=10 * degree)
odf_cpx = calcDensity(ebsd['d'].orientations, halfwidth=10 * degree)
```

A phase may be selected by an unambiguous initial, as above. Use the full
mineral name when two phase names start with the same letter. This route is
not limited to EBSD: an ODF reconstructed from X-ray or neutron diffraction
can enter the same calculation.

```python
CVoigt_ol, CReuss_ol, CHill_ol = mean(C_Fo, odf_ol, 'all')
CVoigt_opx, CReuss_opx, CHill_opx = mean(C_opx, odf_opx, 'all')
CVoigt_cpx, CReuss_cpx, CHill_cpx = mean(C_cpx, odf_cpx, 'all')
```

The indexed phase fractions computed at the start are the weights for the
multiphase mean. They sum to one, so notIndexed pixels contribute neither a
tensor nor an artificial fourth phase.

```python
CVoigtOdf, CReussOdf, CHillOdf = mean(cat(CVoigt_ol, CVoigt_opx, CVoigt_cpx), 'all', weights=phaseFraction)

CHillOdf
```

```text

    -3.135   -1.8272   -0.3055   1.6588   2.1661  74.4987
```

```python
plotSeismicVelocities(CHillOdf)
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/CPOSeismicProperties-16.png"></center>

The ODF-based plot should reproduce the broad pattern of the direct EBSD
average. It need not be identical because the 10 degree kernel smooths each
measured orientation distribution before the tensor is averaged.

## Technical Details

MATLAB's `ebsd('f')` is `ebsd['f']` here, `rot * ebsd` turns the positions and the
orientations together, and the three outputs of `calcTensor` and of `mean` are asked for
with `'all'`, as Python cannot count the outputs a caller takes. MATLAB's list
`[CVoigt_ol, CVoigt_opx, CVoigt_cpx]` is `cat(...)`, which keeps one density per tensor for
the weighted mean; the Hill tensor of the three ODF averages, its density 3.3449 and its
entries agree with MATLAB's to every digit shown. The anisotropies of the three overview
plots agree to the digit; where two extrema of a panel are nearly equal, as the minima of
the S-wave anisotropy of the ODF average, the port and MATLAB may mark different ones, and
an extremum on the rim is marked at both of its ends.
