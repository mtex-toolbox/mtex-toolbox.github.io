<!--introduction-->

This page assumes the tensor ranks and physical classes introduced in
[Defining Tensorial Properties](TensorDefinition_py.html). It shows how MTEX
applies arithmetic to one tensor or a list without loops. The central
operation is a *contraction*: a sum over selected component indices.

The rotation examples also assume the active rotations introduced in
[Defining Rotations](RotationDefinition_py.html).

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
from mtex import *
```

```python
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
```

## Basic algebra

Addition, scalar multiplication, and elementwise operations follow the array
notation. These variables each contain three random rank 2 tensors,
so every line below acts on all three at once.

```python
T1 = tensor.rand(3, rank=2)
T2 = tensor.rand(3, rank=2)

# addition and scalar multiplication
T = T1 + 2 * T2

# componentwise multiplication
T = times(T1, T2)
```

The function `times`, MATLAB's operator `.*`, multiplies corresponding components. It is
not an outer product and does not change the rank. The random tensors are algebraic
examples rather than tensors with the symmetries of a physical property.

## Contractions with EinsteinSum

Hooke's law is a useful model for reading a contraction. The following
rank 4 stiffness tensor contains room-temperature measurements for San
Carlos olivine from
[Abramson et al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1029/97JB00682).
[Importing Tensor Data](TensorImport_py.html) explains the loading step and
the reference-frame information that must accompany published components.

```python
C = stiffnessTensor.load(mtexdatafile('olivine1997'))
```

The data are in GPa. Apply a strain that stretches along x and compresses
along z.

```python
eps = strainTensor(np.diag([1, 0, -1]))
eps
```

```text
strainTensor (y↑→x)
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  1  0   0
  0  0   0
  0  0  -1
```

Hooke's law contracts the last two indices of the stiffness with the two
indices of the strain,

$$\sigma_{ij} = \sum_{k,l} C_{ijkl} \epsilon_{kl}.$$

[EinsteinSum](EinsteinSum.html) takes each tensor followed by one label
for each of its indices. Equal negative labels mark indices to sum over.
Positive labels survive, and their values set the index order in the
result. The signs are MTEX syntax; the physical indices are not negative.

```python
sigma = EinsteinSum(C, [1, 2, -1, -2], eps, [-1, -2])
sigma
```

```text
tensor (y↑→x)
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  248.9      0       0
      0  -8.65       0
      0      0  -161.9
```

Labels 1 and 2 leave a rank 2 result. Its diagonal normal stresses are
248.9, -8.65, and -161.9 GPa; all shear components are zero.

The same notation describes elementary products. The outer product

$$ (a \otimes b)_{ij} = a_i b_j $$

has two free indices and no summation.

```python
a = tensor([1, 2, 3], rank=1)
b = tensor([0, 2, 1], rank=1)
```

---

```python
ab = EinsteinSum(a, 1, b, 2)
ab
```

```text
tensor (y↑→x)
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  0  2  1
  0  4  2
  0  6  3
```

The inner product

$$ a \mathbin{\cdot} b = \sum_i a_i b_i $$

instead repeats one negative label and leaves no free index. Its result is
the scalar 7.

```python
aDotB = EinsteinSum(a, -1, b, -1)
aDotB
```

```text
7
```

## Stiffness is not compliance

Linear compressibility is the relative shortening along a direction `v`
under unit hydrostatic pressure. It is a contraction of the *compliance*
$$S=C^{-1}$$,

$$ \beta(v) = \sum_{i,j,k} S_{ijkk} v_i v_j.$$

[inv](tensor.inv.html) turns the stiffness into a compliance tensor. The
data file identifies x with [100], the crystallographic a direction.

```python
v = xvector
S = inv(C)
beta = EinsteinSum(S, [-1, -2, -3, -3], v, -1, v, -2)
beta
```

```text
0.0018
```

The result is 0.0018 GPa$$^{-1}$$. It is the same contraction used by
[linearCompressibility](stiffnessTensor.linearCompressibility.html).

```python
betaDirect = C.linearCompressibility(v)
```

Contracting the stiffness in the same way is dimensionally wrong. The
result is 460.25 GPa, not a compressibility.

```python
wrongUnits = EinsteinSum(C, [-1, -2, -3, -3], v, -1, v, -2)
wrongUnits
```

```text
460.2500
```

## Named contractions

Frequently used contractions have operators. For a stiffness and a
strain, both `*` and `colon`, MATLAB's `:`, apply Hooke's law. They also preserve the
physical result class, so the first command displays a `stressTensor` rather than
the generic `tensor` returned by `EinsteinSum`.

```python
sigmaTimes = C * eps
sigmaColon = colon(C, eps)
sigmaTimes
```

```text
stressTensor (y↑→x)
  rank: 2 (3 × 3)
  248.9      0       0
      0  -8.65       0
      0      0  -161.9
```

Between two rank 2 tensors, the double dot product is their inner product.
It is also the trace of either matrix product below. Each result here is a
list of three scalars because `T1` and `T2` are lists.

```python
inner = colon(T1, T2)
innerFromLeftTrace = trace(T1 * T2.T)
innerFromRightTrace = trace(T1.T * T2)
inner
```

```text
array([-0.1906,  4.0333, -2.4962])
```

## Rank 2 matrix operations

[det](tensor.det.html) returns one determinant for each rank 2 tensor in
the list.

```python
d = det(T1)
d
```

```text
array([-0.9498, -6.7107,  3.047 ])
```

## Rotating a tensor

[rotate](tensor.rotate.html) actively rotates a physical property. The
workshop example below starts with a second-rank thermal-conductivity
tensor whose largest value, 10.5 W m$$^{-1}$$ K$$^{-1}$$, is along x. The
rotation moves that preferred direction 45 degrees about z.

```python
K = tensor(np.diag([10.5, 6.2, 6.2]), rank=2, name='thermal conductivity', unit='W m^-1 K^-1')
r = rotation.byAxisAngle(zvector, 45 * degree)
Krot = rotate(K, r)

newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 2])
plot(K, complete=True, upper=True)
mtexTitle('before rotation')

nextAxis()
plot(Krot, complete=True, upper=True)
mtexTitle('after rotation')

setColorRange('equal')
mtexColorbar(title='thermal conductivity (W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$)')
```

<center class="mtex-figure"><img class="inline" src="figures/python/TensorArithmetics-17.png"></center>

The high-conductivity region turns in the right plot, while its maximum
stays 10.5. A rank 2 tensor receives one rotation matrix per index,

$$ K'_{ij} = \sum_{p,q} R_{ip} R_{jq} K_{pq}. $$

Rotating the property is not a *frame change*. A frame change re-expresses
the same physical object in another reference frame. Use
[transformReferenceFrame](tensor.transformReferenceFrame.html) for that
operation; [Reference Frame Alignment](SymmetryAlignment_py.html) shows why
the distinction matters for published crystal properties.

## A third-rank example

Nye gives the following piezoelectric modulus for a crystal with one
threefold axis. The two printed component tables show the same property
before and after an active rotation of -45 degrees about z.

```python
P = np.array([[0, 0, 0, .17, 0,   0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0,   .17, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0,   0,   5.17]]) * 10**-11

P0 = tensor(P, rank=3, name='piezoelectric modulus')
P0
```

```text
tensor (y↑→x)
  name: piezoelectric modulus
  rank: 3 (3 × 3 × 3)
  tensor in compact matrix form: *10^-11
  0  0  0  0.17     0     0
  0  0  0     0  0.17     0
  0  0  0     0     0  5.17
```

---

```python
rPiezo = rotation.byAxisAngle(zvector, -45 * degree)
P45 = rotate(P0, rPiezo)
P45
```

```text
tensor (y↑→x)
  name: piezoelectric modulus
  rank: 3 (3 × 3 × 3)
  tensor in compact matrix form: *10^-11
     0      0  0      0  0.17  0
     0      0  0  -0.17     0  0
  5.17  -5.17  0      0     0  0
```

Components that were zero before the rotation are nonzero afterwards.
Nothing about the crystal changed internally: the component table changed
because the property now points in different specimen directions.
