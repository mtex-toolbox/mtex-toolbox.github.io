<!--introduction-->
<p>Orientation maps determined by EBSD or any other technique are, as all experimental data, effected by measurement errors. Those measurement errors can be divided into systematic errors and random errors. Systematic errors mostly occur due to a bad calibration of the EBSD system and require additional knowledge to be corrected. Deviations from the true orientation due to noisy Kikuchi pattern or tolerances of the indexing algorithm can be modeled as random errors. In this section we demonstrate how random errors can be significantly reduced using denoising techniques.</p>
<p>Denoising orientation maps may also include filling not indexed pixels. This is explained in the section <a href="EBSDFilling.html">Fill Missing Data</a>.</p>
<!--/introduction-->
<p>We shall demonstrate the denoising capabilities of MTEX at the hand of an orientation map of deformed Magnesium.</p>

<p>At the first glance, the orientation data look not noisy at all. However, if we look at orientation changes within the grains the noise we become clearly visible. To do so we colorize the orientation data with respect to their misorientation to the grain mean orientation</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
% the axisAngleColorKey colorizes misorientation according to their axis and angle
colorKey = axisAngleColorKey;

% we set the reference orientations as the mean orientation of each grain
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsd.grainId).meanOrientation;

% lets plot the result
plot(ebsd,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsd.orientations))
hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off
{% endhighlight %}
<center>
{% include inline_image.html file="EBSDDenoising_02.png" %}
</center>
<p>We clearly observe some deformation gradients withing the grains which are superposed by random noise.</p>
<h2 id="4">The Mean Filter</h2>
<p>The simplest filter to apply to orientation data is the <a href="meanFilter.html">meanFilter</a> which replaces all orientations by the mean of all neighboring orientations.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
% define the meanFilter
F = meanFilter;
F.numNeighbours = 1;

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS, colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off
{% endhighlight %}
<center>
{% include inline_image.html file="EBSDDenoising_03.png" %}
</center>
<p>We clearly see how the noise has been reduces. In order to further reduce the noise we may increase the number of neighbors that are taken into account.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
F.numNeighbours = 3;

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="6">The Median Filter</h2>
<p>The disadvantage of the mean filter is that is smoothes away all subgrain boundaries and is quite sensitive against outliers. A more robust filter which also preserves subgrain boundaries is the median filter</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
F = medianFilter;

% define the size of the window to be used for finding the median
F.numNeighbours = 3; % this corresponds to a 7x7 window

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off
{% endhighlight %}
<center>
{% include inline_image.html file="EBSDDenoising_05.png" %}
</center>
<p>The disadvantage of the median filter is that it leads to cartoon like images which suffer from the staircase effect.</p>
<h2 id="8">The Kuwahara Filter</h2>
<p>Another filter that was designed to be robust against outliers and does not smooth away subgrain boundaries is the Kuwahara filter. However, in practical applications the results are often not satisfactory.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
F = KuwaharaFilter;
F.numNeighbours = 5;

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off
{% endhighlight %}
<center>
{% include inline_image.html file="EBSDDenoising_06.png" %}
</center>
<h2 id="9">The Smoothing Spline Filter</h2>
<p>All the above filters are so called sliding windows filters which consider for the denoising operation only neighboring orientations within a certain window. The next filters belong to the class of variational filters which determine the denoised orientation map as the solution of an minimization problem that is simultaneously close to the original map and "smooth". The resulting orientation map heavily depends on the specific definition of "smooth" and on the regularization parameter which controls the trade of between fitting the original data and forcing the resulting map to be smooth.</p>
<p>The <a href="splineFilter.html">splineFilter</a> uses as definition of smoothness the curvature of the orientation map. As a consequence, the denoised images are very "round" and similarly as for the <a href="meanFilter.html">meanFilter</a> subgrain boundaries will be smoothed away. On the positive side the <a href="meanFilter.html">meanFilter</a> is up to now the only filter that automatically calibrates the regularization parameter.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
F = splineFilter;

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

<h2 id="10">The Halfquadratic Filter</h2>
<p>In the default setting the <a href="halfQuadraticFilter.html">halfQuadraticFilter</a> uses definition of smoothness the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_variation_denoising">total variation</a> functional. This functional was developed to preserve subgrain boundaries. Similarly as the <a href="medianFilter.html">medianFilter</a> it tends to carton like images and staircasing.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
F = halfQuadraticFilter;

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)

{% include inline_image.html file="EBSDDenoising_08.png" %}

<h2 id="11">The Infimal Convolution Filter</h2>
<p>The infimal convolution filter was designed as a compromise between the <a href="splineFilter.html">splineFilter</a> and the <a href="halfQuadraticFilter.html">halfQuadraticFilter</a>. It is still under development and its use is not recommended.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
F = infimalConvolutionFilter;
F.lambda = 0.01; % smoothing parameter for the gradient
F.mu = 0.005;    % smoothing parameter for the hessian

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))
