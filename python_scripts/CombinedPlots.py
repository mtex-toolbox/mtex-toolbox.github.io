# # Combined Plots
#
# Many scientific figures put related information together. Examples include
# measurements over a fitted function, two data sets in one projection, or
# crystal directions on an inverse pole figure.
#
# MTEX offers three ways to combine plots. The right choice depends on
# whether the figure has one axis, several managed axes, or independent
# panels.
#
# This page assumes the plot types from [Plot Types](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PlotTypes_py.html) and the
# screen frame from [Axes Alignment](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/AxesAlignment_py.html). The examples also
# use pole figures, inverse pole figures, and three-dimensional orientation
# plots. Follow the links where each first appears if these are unfamiliar.

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')

# ## Holding a Plot
#
# The MATLAB way is `hold on`, here `hold(True)`. It keeps what is drawn,
# so the next command adds to it rather than replacing it. The command
# `hold(False)` ends that state.

# %%
plt.close('all')
plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 2], linewidth=2)

hold(True)

plt.plot([1, 2], [1, 3], linewidth=2)

hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The sloping line is added without erasing the horizontal one. After
# `hold(False)`, the next high-level plotting command may replace both.
#
# ## Two Data Sets in One Projection
#
# Start with a compact set of orientations and rotate a copy of its parent
# distribution.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('-3m')
odf = unimodalODF(orientation.byEuler(0, 0, 0, cs))
ori = discreteSample(odf, 100)
oriRotated = discreteSample(rotate(odf, rotation.byEuler(60 * degree, 60 * degree, 0 * degree)), 100)

# %% [markdown]
# Draw both sets in axis--angle space. Each orientation becomes a point whose
# direction is its rotation axis. Its distance from the origin is the
# rotation angle. See [3D Orientation Visualizations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationVisualization3d_py.html)
# for this representation.

# %%
scatter(ori, 'axisAngle')
hold(True)   # keep plot
scatter(oriRotated)
hold(False)  # next plot command deletes all plots

# %% [markdown]
# The figure holds three clouds. The original set is a single compact blob
# near the origin. The rotated set is one cluster too, but it appears as two
# lobes in opposite corners of the region: once a cluster sits far from the
# identity, its symmetrically equivalent representatives no longer all fall
# in the same corner.
#
# Either way the rotated points occupy different ground from the original
# ones, which shows that the rotation changed the orientations rather than
# only their plotted description.
#
# ## The Same Data in Pole Figures
#
# Project the same comparison along two crystal directions. The second
# `plotPF` does not repeat the `antipodal` flag. The existing axes already
# define that symmetry. Added data must conform to those axes.

# %%
h = [Miller(0, 0, 0, 1, cs), Miller(1, 0, -1, 0, cs)]
plotPF(ori, h, antipodal=True, markerSize=4)
hold(True)
plotPF(oriRotated, h, markerSize=4)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Both pole-figure panels contain the two orientation sets. Here `plotPF`
# sees the two crystal directions. It adds the second set to both matching
# axes. That multi-axis behaviour belongs to `plotPF`, not to `hold` itself.
#
# ## Adding to Every Axis at Once
#
# `hold(True)` changes only the *current* axis. A pole-figure figure has one axis
# per crystal direction. The general way to add one data set to every MTEX
# axis is the `add2all` flag.

# %%
plotPF(odf, h, antipodal=True, contourf=True, grid=True)
mtexColorMap('white2black')

plot(ori, displayName='original', markerSize=5, markerFaceColor='b', markerEdgeColor='w', add2all=True)

plot(oriRotated, displayName='rotated', markerSize=5, markerFaceColor='r', markerEdgeColor='k', add2all=True)

legend('show', location='northeast')

# %% [markdown]
# Each orientation set appears in both pole figures after one command. MTEX
# reprojects the orientations according to the crystal direction stored on
# each axis. Plain `hold(True)` neither selects all axes nor performs that
# dispatch.
#
# ODF sections work the same way, and here it matters more: there are eight
# axes, and every orientation belongs in the section closest to it.

# %%
plotSection(odf, 'sigma', sections=8, contourf=True)
mtexColorMap('white2black')
plot(ori, markerSize=6, markerFaceColor='b', markerEdgeColor='w', add2all=True)
plot(oriRotated, markerSize=6, markerFaceColor='r', markerEdgeColor='k', add2all=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Both sets place markers in every section, so the section a marker lands in
# does not by itself separate the two. What distinguishes them is where they
# sit within a section: the original markers follow the contours of the ODF,
# and the rotated ones do not.
#
# ## Marking Crystal Directions
#
# An inverse pole figure fixes a specimen direction and maps the crystal
# directions parallel to it. See [Inverse Pole Figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFInversePoleFigure_py.html)
# for the construction. Marking important crystal directions makes
# the plot readable.
# The `symmetrised` flag draws every symmetrically equivalent direction,
# while `labeled` writes the indices beside them.

# %%
plotIPF(odf, xvector, axisLabels=False)
mtexColorMap('white2black')

hold(True)   # keep plot
plot(Miller(0, 0, 0, 1, cs), symmetrised=True, labeled=True, backgroundColor='w')
plot(Miller(1, 1, -2, 0, cs), symmetrised=True, labeled=True, backgroundColor='w')
plot(Miller(0, 1, -1, 0, cs), symmetrised=True, labeled=True, backgroundColor='w')
plot(Miller(0, 1, -1, 1, cs), symmetrised=True, labeled=True, backgroundColor='w')
hold(False)  # next plot command deletes all plots

# %% [markdown]
# The labels expose an important correction: the maximum is not at (0001).
# This ODF is centred on the identity orientation, so specimen X corresponds
# to a crystal direction in the basal plane. A c-axis maximum would instead
# appear in the inverse pole figure for specimen Z.
#
# ## Different Plots Side by Side
#
# The third case arranges several independent plots rather than overlaying
# them. The MTEX commands used below accept a `parent` axes, so matplotlib's
# own `subplot` can do the arranging.
