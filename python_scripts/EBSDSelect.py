# # Select EBSD data
#
# An EBSD variable is a list of measurements. Selecting part of the specimen, one phase,
# or measurements that satisfy a quality condition is therefore ordinary list indexing.
# The result is another EBSD variable, so the same phase, position, orientation, and
# plotting operations apply to it. This is the EBSD version of
# [Lists and Indexing](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ListsAndIndexing_py.html).
#
# Each measurement may also carry a per-pixel *property*, such as mean angular deviation
# `mad` or band contrast `bc`. A property has one value per measurement and is selected in
# lockstep with the map; see [Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Properties_py.html).

# The phase map contains three indexed phases. The white points belong to the
# `notIndexed` phase, where a diffraction pattern was recorded but could not be indexed.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Selecting a phase
#
# A mineral name used as an index restricts the list to that phase.

# %%
ebsd['Forsterite']

# %% [markdown]
# Two things in that display are worth noticing. The list is shorter: 152345 of the 245952
# measurements are forsterite. Its grid is gone as well. A selection is generally not a
# full rectangular grid, although every retained measurement still has its original
# position.
#
# Use [gridify](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.gridify.html) when later code explicitly needs a matrix-shaped map.
# Many spatial MTEX operations reconstruct the virtual lattice internally;
# [Square and Hex Grids](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGrid_py.html) explains when the stored grid shape matters.
#
# A prefix of a mineral name works as an abbreviation when it begins one mineral only, so
# use the full name when two phase names begin alike. Several phases are selected by
# grouping their names in a list.

# %%
ebsd[['Fo', 'En']]

# %% [markdown]
# Two names are available whatever the minerals are called. The name `'indexed'` selects
# every point matched to a phase. The degenerate phase `'notIndexed'` selects points whose
# diffraction pattern could not be indexed.

# The red rectangle crosses all three indexed phases and many notIndexed points.
# [inpolygon](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.inpolygon.html) tests every measurement and returns one `True` or
# `False` for each point.

condition = inpolygon(ebsd, region)

# Logical indexing keeps the points for which the condition is `True`: 20301 of the 245952

# The cropped map keeps its specimen coordinates rather than being moved to the origin.
# Only its extent and list membership have changed.
#
# A region need not be rectangular. `inpolygon` also accepts the vertices of any closed
# polygon.

# ## Screening measurements by fit quality
#
# Indexing software stores quantities that describe the pattern solution. Oxford Channel
# maps commonly provide the mean angular deviation `mad`, for which lower values mean a
# closer angular fit. EDAX OIM maps commonly provide a confidence index `ci`, for which
# higher values mean that the winning indexed solution is better separated from the
# runner-up.
#
# These quantities are not interchangeable measures of orientation error. A threshold
# flags measurements for scrutiny; it does not prove that an orientation is wrong. Inspect
# the spatial map and the distribution before choosing a data-dependent threshold.

# %% [markdown]
# Most of the map sits at about 0.4°. The deep blue patches are the notIndexed points,
# which report 0. The yellow speckles are the worst fits in this map and lie mainly along
# grain boundaries, where the interaction volume can contain signal from two crystals. A
# histogram shows the populations more clearly.

# The tallest bar is at zero. It is not a population of perfect fits but the notIndexed
# points again. The indexed measurements run from 0.1° to 1.2°, with the bulk at 0.4°. A
# cut at 0.8° removes the tail and keeps 96% of all points in the region.

# The yellow speckles have gone, because every measurement above 0.8° was removed. Those
# 881 positions are now empty and render as background.
#
# The deep blue patches are still there, and that is the point to take from this figure.
# This threshold does *not* remove notIndexed points: they have no fit to report, so their
# `mad` is stored as 0 and passes every smaller-than test. All 4052 notIndexed points are
# still in the map above.
#
# Dropping them is a separate phase selection. The deliberate output below shows how many
# indexed measurements remain.

# ## Combining selections
#
# Conditions combine with NumPy's elementwise `&` and `|` operators, or a phase name can
# narrow a logical selection. This example applies the region and MAD conditions together,
# then keeps only forsterite.

# %%
keep = inpolygon(ebsd, region) & (ebsd.mad < 0.8)
goodForsterite = ebsd[keep]
goodForsterite = goodForsterite['Forsterite']

# %% [markdown]
# Whether notIndexed points should be dropped depends on the analysis that follows. Their
# locations often record cracks, poor surface preparation, unresolved phases, or difficult
# grain boundaries. Keep the raw variable and assign a selection to a new name so that
# this information is not overwritten. [Filling Missing Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDFilling_py.html) explains
# how missing orientations can be treated without pretending they were measured.
