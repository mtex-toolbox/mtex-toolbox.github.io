# # Operations with Three-Dimensional Grains
#
# The [Three-Dimensional EBSD Analysis](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD3Analysis_py.html) overview distinguishes volume
# measurements from the `grain3d` surface representation. This page shows how to cut those
# grains into a planar map, replace polygonal faces by triangles, and rotate geometry
# together with orientation.
#
# The examples use the synthetic tessellation introduced on the
# [Neper Interface](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/NeperInterface_py.html) page. The preceding
# [Properties of Three-Dimensional Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DProperties_py.html) page explains the
# volume, surface, and face properties used below.

# Each colour represents the mean orientation of one grain. The outer faces hide most of

# ## Cut one planar section
#
# [Three-Dimensional Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3D_py.html) introduces planar sectioning and the `grain2d`
# result. The direct form of `slice` used here specifies the plane by a normal `N` and any
# point `P0` in the plane.

# point through which the plane passes
P0 = grains.midPoint

# plane normal
N = vector3d(1, -1, 1)

grainSlice = grains.slice(N, P0)

# The polygons are cuts through grains, not complete grains. A grain that is large in this

# original collection. Use it to recover the full polyhedra that produced selected section
# polygons.

# The dashed line marks equal diameters. The spread reflects both the cutting position and
# grain shape. It is not a calibration curve: a differently placed plane samples different
# grains, and elongated grains can have section diameters above the line.

# ## Compare several parallel sections
#
# Several slices require several calls to `slice`. Drawing horizontal cuts together shows
# how little of the volume any single section represents.

# The face count increases while the displayed shape is unchanged: the new triangles cover
# the same boundary polygons. Triangulation changes the mesh representation, not the
# physical grains or their stored mean orientations.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Rotate geometry and orientation together
#
# `rotate` turns grains in space. By default it rotates both things a grain carries: its
# shape and its orientation. Rotating only one of them would describe a different specimen
# rather than the same specimen seen differently.

# %%
rot = rotation.byAxisAngle(vector3d(1, 1, 1), 30 * degree)
grainsRotated = rot * grains

plot(grainsRotated, grainsRotated.meanOrientation, micronbar='off', edgeAlpha=0.1)
setCamera(plottingConvention.default3D)

# %% [markdown]
# The shape has turned about the coordinate origin, and the colours change. An IPF colour
# says which crystal direction points along a fixed specimen axis. The same rotation is
# applied to all orientations; symmetry-reduced orientation differences need not equal
# that rotation angle. A rigid rotation preserves the relation between grains, while
# changing their relation to the coordinate axes.
#
# The method form provides a `center` option when the spatial rotation should use a point
# other than the origin.

# %%
rotationCenter = grains.midPoint
grainsAboutCenter = rotate(grains, rot, center=rotationCenter)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Rotate only one part of the data
#
# Two flags deliberately decouple geometry from orientation. The names say which values
# are kept fixed, not which values are rotated.
#
# | Flag | Geometry | Mean orientation |
# | --- | --- | --- |
# | `'keepEuler'` | rotated | unchanged |
# | `'keepXY'` | unchanged | rotated |
#
# For example, the first command below turns the vertices while retaining the orientation
# values. The second changes the orientations while retaining the vertices.

# %%
geometryOnly = rotate(grains, rot, 'keepEuler')
orientationOnly = rotate(grains, rot, 'keepXY')

# %% [markdown]
# These flags are useful when geometry and orientation require separate corrections. They
# do not represent a rigid rotation of the whole specimen. The `center` option affects only
# a spatial rotation, so it has no effect when `'keepXY'` leaves the geometry unchanged.

# ## Technical details
#
# `Id3d` holds the ids of the parent grains, so the parents are `grains['id', Id3d]`;
# MATLAB's text calls it an array position, which in an unfiltered collection is the same
# number. The loop over parallel sections needs no `rmappdata`, the interactive selection
# of MATLAB's figure. MATLAB's `grains(20:21)` is `grains[19:21]`.
