# # Import Pole Figure Data
#
# A pole-figure file brings three pieces of information into one object. They are the
# measured specimen directions, the intensity at each direction and the lattice plane
# whose diffraction peak was measured. Importing is therefore more than reading a numeric
# table. The crystal symmetry, Miller indices and angular units have to be stated
# correctly. So does the specimen frame, before an ODF can be reconstructed.
#
# MTEX stores the result in a [PoleFigure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.PoleFigure.html) object. Its entries
# are one or more measured pole figures, not pixels or individual orientations. The
# imported values are diffraction intensities. They are not yet normalized pole densities
# in multiples of a random distribution (mrd).
#
# This page assumes the pole-figure idea from [Pole Figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureAnalysis.html).
# Miller-index notation is introduced in [Miller Indices](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalDirections_py.html). Review
# it if unfamiliar.

# ## Start with the import wizard
#
# For an unfamiliar format, start the graphical wizard by entering
#
#     importWizard()
#
# and select *Pole Figure Data*. The preview makes it possible to identify columns,
# angular units and the specimen axes before importing. The wizard can put the result in
# the workspace. Its more valuable output is an import script. Save that script with the
# analysis so the choices can be checked and the import repeated.
#
# The wizard asks for the [crystal symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalSymmetries_py.html), the Miller index of
# every measured reflection, and the specimen convention. These are scientific inputs, not
# display preferences. A plotting convention changes only where a direction is drawn.
# Correcting a wrong specimen frame changes what the data mean. The same distinction is
# explained in [Reference Frames](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) for EBSD.

# %% [markdown]
# ## A reproducible import script
#
# The following is the essential script for the bundled Dubna quartz data. Declare the
# plotting convention before loading so the specimen directions enter the intended frame.

# %%
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')

cs = crystalFrame('32', [1.4, 1.4, 1.5])

# %% [markdown]
# The `cs` definition pairs trigonal symmetry with a crystal frame. That frame holds the
# relative lattice parameters and interprets Miller indices. Both must describe the
# measured phase. The default frame is X||a*, Z||c.

# %% [markdown]
# The two entries below correspond one for one to the two filenames. The first file
# measures one reflection, $(10\bar{1}0)$. The peak in the second file contains two
# reflections. The instrument could not resolve them, so its entry contains two Miller
# indices.

# %%
h = [Miller(1, 0, -1, 0, cs), Miller([[0, 1, -1, 1], [1, 0, -1, 1]], cs)]

# %% [markdown]
# A combined peak is a weighted sum. Its relative structure coefficients must be supplied
# in the same order as its Miller indices. The first pole figure has only one contribution
# and therefore weight 1.

# %%
c = [1, [0.52, 1.23]]

# %% [markdown]
# [PoleFigure.load](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.load.html) detects the file format and joins the files,
# reflections and weights into one object.

# %%
pf = PoleFigure.load(fnames, h, cs, superposition=c)

# ## What was imported
#
# The display reports the crystal symmetry and one line per measured pole figure. Here
# both files contain a $72 \times 19$ grid of specimen directions. The double Miller label
# on the second line is deliberate. It records the superposed peak rather than pretending
# it was one reflection.
#
# The four parts of the object can be inspected directly:
#
# * `pf.allH` contains the crystal plane normals;
# * `pf.allR` contains the specimen directions at which intensities were measured;
# * `pf.allI` contains those intensities; and
# * `pf.c` contains the structure coefficients.
#
# The list structure matters because different pole figures may have different grids and
# different numbers of contributing reflections.

# %%

# %% [markdown]

# %%
pf.c

# %% [markdown]
# Plot the raw measurements immediately. This catches transposed polar and azimuth columns
# or degrees read as radians. A flipped specimen axis and missing values are also visible.
# So are implausible intensity ranges, before any of them is mistaken for an ODF problem.

# %%

mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# Both panels use the same $72 \times 19$ direction grid, but their strong spots occupy
# different regions. The title of the second panel contains two Miller indices because it
# is the unresolved peak. Notice also that its raw intensity scale is much larger than the
# first. Raw scales must not be compared as mrd before correction and normalization.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Superposed reflections are part of the measurement model
#
# The coefficients in `pf.c` are not optional cosmetic weights. For the second file the
# forward model used during reconstruction is the sum
#
# $$I(r) = 0.52\,P_{(01\bar{1}1)}(r) + 1.23\,P_{(10\bar{1}1)}(r).$$
#
# Replacing that pair by one Miller index asks the inversion to explain a measured sum as
# a single pole figure. This generally biases the recovered ODF. If peaks overlap, record
# every contributing reflection. Use relative coefficients appropriate to the radiation
# and measured phase.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Generic text files
#
# When no dedicated reader matches, MTEX falls back to the
# [generic ASCII reader](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/loadPoleFigure_generic.html). A common file is one row per
# measurement,
#
#     polar_angle  azimuth_angle  intensity
#
# with any number of header or unused columns. State the column meanings and positions
# explicitly when they cannot be inferred safely. State the angular unit as well. For
# example:
#
#     pf = PoleFigure.load(fname, Miller(1, 1, 1, cs), cs, interface='generic',
#                          columnNames=['polar angle', 'azimuth angle', 'intensity'],
#                          columns=[0, 1, 2], header=21)
#
# The columns are counted from zero, the angles are read in degrees unless `radians=True`
# is given. Supplying the Miller index is safer than relying on a filename. A name with an
# unrelated number can otherwise be mistaken for a reflection. If auto-detection chooses
# the wrong reader, select one with `interface`. For example, use `interface='dubna'` for
# this format.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Supported formats and custom readers
#
# MTEX ships readers for common text and vendor formats. The interface names of this port
# are `dubna`, `siemens`, `geesthacht`, `uxd`, `aachen_exp`, `rw1` and `generic`. Together
# they cover Dubna, Siemens, Geesthacht, Bruker and Aachen data and any three column
# table; the PopLA, LaboTEX, BearTex, Philips, Rigaku, Juelich and PANalytical readers of
# MATLAB MTEX are not ported yet.
#
# [PoleFigure.load](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.load.html) tries the installed `loadPoleFigure_*` readers
# and then the generic reader. Its reference page is version-specific. So are the reader
# functions in `mtex/io/loadpolefigure.py`.
#
# A format-specific reader is an ordinary function, `_loadPoleFigure_name` by the convention of that module, that
# returns a `PoleFigure` object. Register it in the loader table of that module and call
#
#     pf = PoleFigure.load(fname, ..., interface='name')
#
# during development. The [Dubna reader](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/loadPoleFigure_dubna.html) in
# `mtex/io/loadpolefigure.py` is a compact format-specific template, the
# [generic reader](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/loadPoleFigure_generic.html) beside it the corresponding generic
# template.

# ## Before reconstructing an ODF
#
# Confirm the phase, lattice parameters and reflection assigned to every file. Confirm all
# superposition coefficients, the angular unit, specimen axes, intensity range and angular
# coverage. Apply only justified background, defocusing and normalization corrections.
# They are explained in [Modify Pole Figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureCorrection_py.html). Continue
# afterwards to [ODF Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html).

# ## Technical Details
#
# The sample files are fetched by `mtexdatafile('dubna')` on first use and kept under the
# data path, which is where MATLAB's `mtexDataPath` points; the page picks two of the seven
# by position. A superposed entry is one `Miller` list built from a matrix with one row of
# four indices per reflection, where MATLAB concatenates two `Miller` objects. The generic
# reader counts its columns from zero and reads degrees by default.
