# # MTEX Scripts
#
# MTEX has no graphical user interface for an analysis. You work with MTEX by writing Python
# scripts: text files that keep the commands for an analysis in a reproducible order.
#
# A typical script follows five steps.
#
# 1. Import data.
# 2. Inspect the imported data.
# 3. Correct the data when necessary.
# 4. Analyze the data.
# 5. Plot and export the results.
#
# During these steps, Python stores data under names called variables. Each variable has a
# type, called its class, which determines the operations that can be applied to it. MTEX
# provides classes for objects such as [vectors](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.vector3d.html),
# [rotations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/rotation.rotation.html), [EBSD data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.EBSD.html),
# [grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.grain2d.html), and
# [orientation distribution functions (ODFs)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.SO3Fun.html). The
# [Function Reference](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/FunctionReference.html) lists all MTEX classes and functions.

# %%
from mtex import *

# %% [markdown]
# ## Import and inspect data
#
# Import functions create variables automatically. Here, `fileName` stores the path to an
# example CTF file. The second command imports that file and stores the result in the
# variable `ebsd`.

# %%
fileName = mtexdatafile('forsterite')
ebsd = EBSD.load(fileName, eulerCorrection=rotation.byAxisAngle(xvector, 180 * degree))
ebsd

# %% [markdown]
# Writing the variable's name on its own line displays a summary of `ebsd`. This is a quick
# inspection step: the summary reports the phases, numbers of orientations, properties, map
# extent, and grid size. The `eulerCorrection` option also corrects the imported orientations
# by the specified rotation.
#
# ## Plot the phase map
#
# Pass a variable to an MTEX function to operate on its data. The command below passes
# `ebsd` to `plot` and colors every indexed measurement by its phase.

# %%
plot(ebsd)

# %% [markdown]
# Notice the large blue forsterite regions, the smaller green enstatite and yellow diopside
# regions, and the white notIndexed areas. A notIndexed measurement is one whose diffraction
# pattern could not be indexed.
#
# ## Reconstruct and inspect grains
#
# The next command segments the measurements into grains. A grain is a phase-homogeneous,
# spatially connected region of EBSD measurements produced by segmentation. The `minPixel`
# option excludes indexed grains with fewer than three measurements.

# %%
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, minPixel=3)
grains

# %% [markdown]
# The returned [grain2d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.grain2d.html) object is stored in `grains`. Its summary
# reports the number of grains in each phase and information about their boundaries.
#
# ## Add the grain boundaries
#
# Plotting on the same axes connects the result of the analysis to the phase map.
# `hold(True)` preserves the existing map while the boundary is added, and `hold(False)` ends
# that plotting state.

# %%
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Notice that the dark lines trace changes between neighboring grains. Some lines lie within
# one color because grains of the same phase can still have different orientations.
#
# ## Organize a script
#
# An MTEX script is a sequence of Python and MTEX commands. Add comments on lines beginning
# with `#` to record why each command is present. These explanations make the analysis
# understandable when the script is reopened.
#
# Divide a longer script into cells with lines beginning with `# %%`. In VS Code, Spyder or
# PyCharm, Shift+Enter runs the current cell in an interactive window and advances to the
# next one. Running one cell at a time lets you inspect each intermediate variable before
# continuing. A Jupyter notebook is the same sequence of cells in another file format;
# `jupytext` converts between the two, and every page of this documentation is such a script
# (`docs/notebook.py <Page>` opens one as a notebook).
