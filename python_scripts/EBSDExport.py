# # Exporting EBSD Data
#
# Exporting writes an `EBSD` map to another file. Begin with a map whose phases and
# [reference frame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) have already been checked.
# [Importing EBSD Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDImport_py.html) introduces the properties, scan-level options
# and header information discussed below.
#
# [export](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.export.html) chooses the exporter from the filename extension.
#
#     # write an Oxford text file
#     export(ebsd, 'myFile.ctf')

# %%
import os
import tempfile

# %%
import numpy as np

# %%
from mtex import *

# ## Choose the output for its purpose
#
# No EBSD file format can represent every part of an MTEX variable. A *property* has one
# value per measurement and is subset with the map. A *header* is scan-level information
# from the imported file, such as acquisition settings and vendor bookkeeping. It remains
# in the vendor's native layout under `ebsd.meta['header']`.
#
# | *Output* | *Use* | *Important limit* |
# |---|---|---|
# | [.ang](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/exportEBSD_ang.html) or [.ctf](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/exportEBSD_ctf.html) | vendor text exchange | fixed columns and format-specific header entries only |
# | [HDF5 extensions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/exportEBSD_h5.html) | return changed data to a vendor container | requires the imported HDF5 provenance and a reference file |
# | another extension, such as `.txt` | a plain numeric table | writes Euler angles, phase ids and numeric properties, but not a complete map archive |
#
# MATLAB writes the Oxford binary pair `.crc` / `.cpr` as well and moves a complete
# variable between sessions in a `.mat` file; neither is ported. Converting between
# formats can therefore lose or rename properties, header entries, phase descriptions and
# acquisition data. Keep the original measurement file, write to a new name and re-import
# the result before relying on it.
#
# The `.ang` and `.ctf` exporters undo the correction applied by the corresponding
# importer between the Euler-angle and map reference frames. This preserves the
# specimen-frame interpretation when the same setting is used on import. It does not
# guarantee that another format can represent the same crystal frame attached to each
# phase.
#
# Both exporters take as much of the rest along as the format allows: whatever the header
# of the imported file stated is kept in `ebsd.meta['header']` and written back out, so
# entries MTEX does not model - the pattern centre, the working distance, the operator -
# are carried over rather than written as zeros.

# ## Verify a text-format conversion
#
# This example converts a bundled CTF map to ANG and imports the new file. The two object
# summaries are useful output: compare the measurement and phase inventories, then
# inspect which per-pixel properties the target format retained.

# %%
ebsd = mtexdata('twins')
ebsd

# %%
exportFile = os.path.join(tempfile.mkdtemp(), 'twins.ang')
export(ebsd, exportFile)
ebsdRoundTrip = EBSD.load(exportFile)
ebsdRoundTrip

# %%
isIndexed = ebsd.isIndexed & ebsdRoundTrip.isIndexed
roundTripError = np.max(angle(ebsd[isIndexed].orientations, ebsdRoundTrip[isIndexed].orientations)) / degree
roundTripError

# %% [markdown]
# Both summaries contain 22,879 measurements: 22,833 indexed magnesium measurements and
# 46 notIndexed measurements. Their property lists differ because ANG and CTF define
# different columns. A missing property name does not always mean that its values
# vanished. The exporter may map a compatible quantity to the target format's name.
#
# Export and import both use ANG setting 2 here, so the relationship between the
# Euler-angle and map reference frames is consistent. The original CTF phase uses X
# parallel to a-star and Y parallel to b, whereas an ANG file supplies X parallel to a
# and Y parallel to b-star: the two files do not carry the same hexagonal crystal frame.
# The readers keep each file's own alignment, the comparison warns that the two frames
# differ, and the `roundTripError` of $30^\circ$ exposes that loss. A successful import and equal
# measurement counts are still not enough to validate a converted map: compare the
# crystal reference frames of the two phases as well.

# ## HDF5: write into a copy of the imported file
#
# HDF5 is a container, not one EBSD data format. Every vendor defines its own hierarchy,
# units and data sets. A vendor file may also contain raw diffraction patterns, electron
# images and acquisition settings that MTEX never imported. Creating a new hierarchy from
# the `EBSD` variable would discard those contents.
#
# The HDF5 exporter instead copies the file from which the map was imported and patches
# the changed values into that copy. The output remains in the vendor's layout.
#
#     ebsd = EBSD.load('myfile.h5oina')
#     ebsd = smooth(ebsd, halfQuadraticFilter())
#
#     # copy myfile.h5oina and replace its orientations
#     export(ebsd, 'denoised.h5oina')
#
# [EBSD.load](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.load.html) records the source file and resolved data-set paths in the
# scan-level option `ebsd.meta['h5']`. A different reference file can be named
# explicitly, but the `EBSD` variable must still carry that HDF5 provenance. The named
# file must contain the recorded paths.
#
#     export(ebsd, 'denoised.h5oina', reference='myfile.h5oina')
#
# The output and reference filenames must differ. The exporter refuses to overwrite the
# reference because a failed write would destroy the only complete copy.
#
# Only measurements that remain in the `EBSD` variable are patched. Other rows remain as
# the reference file stored them. So does every data set that MTEX did not read.
#
# The exporter updates orientations, phases, phase names and lattice values. It does not
# translate point-group symmetry between vendor coding schemes. Per-pixel numeric
# properties return to their original paths. Header contents that MTEX does not model
# survive because the reference file is copied.
#
# A property computed in MTEX is added beside the imported properties when the vendor
# layout has an extensible data group. A compound record has no room for another column.
# The exporter warns and leaves that property out. Pass `properties=False` to update
# orientations and phases while leaving every property in the reference copy unchanged.
#
# A reference file is required. Data that was not imported from HDF5 has no record of
# the paths to patch. Supplying another HDF5 filename still raises an error.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Preserve the complete MTEX variable
#
# MATLAB carries the map between sessions in a MAT-file, which preserves the full
# variable, including properties, scan-level options, reference frames and the imported
# header. Python's `pickle` module plays that role for an `EBSD` variable here. Such a
# file is the lossless working copy, not a substitute for the original acquisition file
# or a documented interchange format. Preserve those alongside it when the data must
# remain usable outside MTEX.
