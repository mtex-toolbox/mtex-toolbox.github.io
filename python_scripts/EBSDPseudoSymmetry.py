# # Correcting Pseudo Symmetry
#
# A *pseudo symmetry* is a rotation that is not a symmetry of the crystal, but maps its
# diffraction pattern almost onto itself. An indexing algorithm may therefore alternate
# between the true orientation and a rotated alternative. One physical crystal region then
# appears as several reconstructed grains, separated by the pseudo-symmetric
# misorientation.
#
# This is an indexing failure, not ordinary orientation noise. It also is not proof of a
# physical domain or twin: a real boundary can have the same misorientation. The command
# [cleanUpPseudoSym](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/cleanUpPseudoSym.html) combines crystallography with a spatial
# heuristic to tell them apart.
#
# The page assumes the grain structure has been reconstructed as described in
# [grain reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html). The pages on
# [boundary misorientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryMisorientations_py.html) and
# [orientation symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationSymmetry_py.html) introduce the geometry used below.
#
# ## A Map With Pseudo Symmetry
#
# Olivine is a classical example. Its oxygen sublattice is almost hexagonally close packed
# with the stacking axis along [100]. Rotations about [100] by multiples of 60 degrees
# therefore map the oxygen positions nearly onto themselves, although the true symmetry
# `mmm` contains only the 180 degree rotation.

# %% [markdown]
# `calcGrains` also assigns the per-measurement property `ebsd.grainId`. The cleanup uses it
# to connect every orientation with its reconstructed grain.
#
# At this scale the pseudo symmetry is invisible. The correction at the end of this page
# moves 274 of the 152345 forsterite measurements, under two tenths of a percent, and it
# does so in patches of a few dozen pixels sitting inside much larger host grains. The rest
# of this page therefore finds those patches by their misorientation, and zooms into one of
# them once they are known.
#
# The boundaries have deliberately *not* been smoothed. Since `cleanUpPseudoSym` decides
# from their raggedness, smoothing must be applied after the correction and not before.
#
# ## Detecting the Pseudo Symmetry
#
# When the pseudo symmetry is not known beforehand, look for it in the distribution of
# boundary misorientations. Olivine suggests a rotation near 60 degrees, so select those
# boundaries and plot the distribution of their rotational axes.

# The sharp maximum at [100] establishes both parts of the candidate: a rotation of about 60
# degrees around [100]. Define that operation as a misorientation with
# [byAxisAngle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.byAxisAngle.html).

# %%
cs = ebsd['Fo'].CS
psSym = orientation.byAxisAngle(Miller(1, 0, 0, cs, 'uvw'), 60 * degree)

# %% [markdown]
# Modulo the true symmetry `mmm`, the rotations by 60 and 120 degrees are different
# operations. The latter is the inverse of the former, and both occur because the indexer
# may have chosen either solution. It is enough to pass one of them to `cleanUpPseudoSym`.
#
# A measurement stores a fixed representative of an orientation. Its alternative is
# therefore not simply `ori * psSym`, but `ori * s * psSym` for some true symmetry element
# `s`. The command generates all these operators itself, so passing 60 degrees, 120
# degrees, or both gives the same result.
#
# The pseudo symmetry is a misorientation, so it has the same crystal symmetry on both
# sides. The condition `psSym.CS is psSym.SS` is required by `cleanUpPseudoSym` and tells
# the command which phase to correct.
#
# ## Pseudo-Symmetric Grain Boundaries
#
# Select all boundary segments whose misorientation matches the candidate. A grain
# boundary has no direction: its misorientation carries the grain exchange symmetry
# explained in [grain exchange symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationGrainExchangeSym_py.html). The test
# therefore catches both indexing alternatives at once.

# The blue patch has been indexed with the alternative solution. Its red boundary
# repeatedly detours around single pixels instead of following a stable interface. This is
# the spatial signature used by the cleanup.
#
# Raggedness is evidence, not proof. A physical interface can be tortuous, and a large,
# coherently misindexed domain can have a smooth outline. Where the distinction matters,
# inspect the original patterns or reindex them against both candidate orientations. This
# post-processing step cannot recover information that the orientation map no longer
# contains.
#
# ## The Tortuosity Criterion
#
# The usual geometric intuition is boundary length divided by the distance between its
# endpoints. The implementation uses a closely related span: the diagonal of each
# component's axis-aligned bounding box. For boundary length $L$ and box diagonal
# $d_{\mathrm{box}}$, it computes
#
# $$ \tau = \frac{L}{d_{\mathrm{box}}}. $$
#
# A straight component has a value close to one, while detours increase its length without
# increasing its span. Because these are unsmoothed grid boundaries, even a physical
# straight interface has some staircase length; the threshold is therefore empirical rather
# than universal.

# Components above the red line are candidates for correction. Very short components are
# unreliable: a single segment has zero box diagonal and hence infinite tortuosity. The
# printed count is two for this map, which is why those components do not appear at a
# finite height in the plot. `cleanUpPseudoSym` considers only components with more than
# four segments.
#
# ## Correcting the Map
#
# `cleanUpPseudoSym` merges grains separated by candidate boundaries and tests the
# available pseudo-symmetry operators at every affected measurement. It selects the
# operator closest to the mean orientation of the merged grain. The intended effect is to
# rotate the smaller alternative patch into the larger one, while the per-measurement test
# avoids assuming that every pixel in that patch chose the same representative.
#
# The command returns the corrected EBSD data, the merged grains, and the number of
# measurements whose orientation changed. Like `calcGrains`, it corrects the map it is
# given, so `ebsdC` is `ebsd` itself; work on `ebsd.copy()` to keep the original.

# The blue alternative patch and its internal boundary have disappeared. The enclosing
# forsterite grain now has one consistent orientation colour, while unrelated grain
# boundaries remain.
#
# Only now, with the pseudo-symmetric boundaries removed, does it make sense to smooth the
# grain boundaries with [smoothBoundary](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.smoothBoundary.html).
#
#     grainsC = smoothBoundary(grainsC, 5)
#
# ## Choosing the Options
#
# The keyword `delta` is the angular tolerance within which a boundary misorientation must
# match the pseudo symmetry. The keyword `threshold` is the minimum tortuosity for
# correction. Their defaults are 2 degrees and 1.5, respectively.
#
#     ebsdC, grainsC, numChanged = cleanUpPseudoSym(ebsd, grains, psSym, delta=2 * degree, threshold=1.5)
#
# Increasing `delta` admits more boundary segments, while lowering `threshold` accepts
# smoother components. Both changes make the cleanup more aggressive and can remove real
# grain boundaries. Inspect the axis distribution, the tortuosity plot, and representative
# regions before choosing either value.
#
# Since the pseudo symmetry determines the corrected phase, only one phase is treated per
# call. To clean several phases, call the command once for each phase with that phase's
# pseudo symmetries.
