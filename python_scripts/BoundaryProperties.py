# # Grain Boundary Properties
#
# A grain boundary is stored as short segments between neighbouring EBSD measurements that
# belong to different grains. Most properties come in pairs: two pixels, grains, phases,
# and the misorientation between them. The remaining properties describe the segment's
# geometry and its place in the boundary network.
#
# This page assumes that the map has already been divided into grains as in
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html).
# [Select Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundarySelect_py.html) covers phase and grain selection.
# [Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainBoundaries.html) explains the physical meaning of a boundary
# trace in a two-dimensional section.
#
# | property | meaning | property | meaning |
# |---|---|---|---|
# | `ebsdId` | neighbouring pixel IDs | `grainId` | neighbouring grain IDs |
# | `phaseId` | neighbouring phase IDs | `misorientation` | rotation across the segment |
# | `F` | endpoint vertex IDs | `direction` | segment direction |
# | `midPoint` | segment midpoint | [segLength](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grainBoundary.segLength.html) | segment length |

# ## Preserve the segment-to-pixel relation
#
# This page uses `ebsdId` to inspect the pixel pair beside each segment. Boundary
# simplification and refinement change the segment count, and a resampled segment no
# longer lies between one specific pixel pair. The
# [smoothBoundary](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.smoothBoundary.html) options `simplify=False` and `refine=False`
# preserve that relation while smoothing.

# The thick black lines show that the boundary is a network of individual segments. Each
# segment separates one pair of neighbouring measurements.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The two sides of a segment
#
# `ebsdId`, `grainId`, and `phaseId` are $N \times 2$ matrices. Each row records what lies
# on the two sides of one segment. Consider the boundary of one small grain:

# %%
gB4 = grains['id', 9].boundary
gB4

# %% [markdown]
# The object summary reports eight segments. Its `ebsdId` property is therefore an 8 by 2
# matrix.

# %%
gB4.ebsdId

# %% [markdown]
# These values are measurement IDs, not positions in the current list. IDs and list
# positions differ as soon as measurements have been removed from the map. Indexing by ID
# must say so explicitly.

# %%
ebsd['id', gB4.ebsdId]

# %% [markdown]
# The grain IDs on the two sides reveal the local grain arrangement.

# %%
gB4.grainId

# %% [markdown]
# Grain 9 has grain 1 on the far side of all eight segments. Grain 9 is therefore an
# inclusion: it is entirely surrounded by one other grain.

# %%
plot(grains['id', 9], faceColor='DarkBlue', micronbar='off')
hold(True)
plot(grains['id', 1], faceColor='LightCoral')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The dark-blue inclusion sits wholly inside the coral grain. The plot is the spatial
# counterpart of the repeated pair `[1 9]` above.

# %% [markdown]
# ## From segments to chains
#
# A *chain* is a maximal run of segments laid end to end. It runs from one junction to the
# next and never passes through a junction. Every segment belongs to exactly one chain.
# The same two grains lie on its two sides along the entire chain.
#
# A *junction* is a vertex where the number of meeting segments is not two. It need not be
# a triple point. For example, the end of a boundary at the map rim is a junction but not
# a point where three real grains meet.
#
# The inclusion boundary reaches no junction and closes onto itself. Its eight segments
# consequently form one closed chain.

# %%
print(f'{"chainId":>10s}{"chainSize":>12s}{"isClosed":>11s}')
print(f'{gB4.chainId[0]:>10d}{gB4.chainSize[0]:>12d}{str(bool(gB4.isClosed[0])):>11s}')

# %% [markdown]
# `arcLength` is the cumulative length from the start of a chain to the end of each
# segment. `chainLength` repeats the total length on every segment, so either property
# remains aligned with the boundary list during indexing.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The misorientation across a segment
#
# A segment's misorientation is the rotation from the orientation of its second pixel to
# that of its first. It follows the column order of `ebsdId` and can be reproduced from
# the two pixel orientations.

# %%
gB4[0].misorientation

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
inv(ebsd['id', gB4.ebsdId[0, 1]].orientations) * ebsd['id', gB4.ebsdId[0, 0]].orientations

# %% [markdown]
# The two rotations agree, but only the stored one has its `antipodal` flag set. A
# boundary has no preferred side, so MTEX treats that rotation and its inverse as the same
# boundary misorientation. The rotation computed directly from two ordered orientations
# retains its direction.
#
# A list of misorientations is meaningful only when every segment relates the same two
# phases. Select the phase pair before analysing angles or axes.

# %%

# Long runs share nearly the same colour, as expected for segments along one twin
# boundary. Most non-twin boundaries form the contrasting shorter runs.
#
# The dominant magnesium twin has a misorientation angle of 86.3 degrees. In this map,
# 52.8 percent of the magnesium segments are within 3 degrees of that angle, and the
# median angle is 84.3 degrees.

# %%

# The high fraction confirms that this specimen is dominated by twin boundaries.
# [Twinning](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TwinningBoundaries_py.html) develops that selection.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Which way a segment runs
#
# `direction` is the direction of the segment trace. Its angle to the misorientation axis
# is used when classifying tilt and twist boundaries. See
# [Twist and Tilt](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TiltAndTwistBoundaries_py.html). Compute the axis in specimen coordinates
# from the two pixel orientations. The stored misorientation alone no longer retains that
# specimen-frame information.

# %%
# compute misorientation axes in specimen coordinates
ori = ebsd['id', gB_Mg.ebsdId].orientations
axes = axis(ori[:, 0], ori[:, 1], antipodal=True)

# plot the angle between each axis and its raw segment direction

# %% [markdown]
# The colour flickers along boundaries that are straight on the scale of several pixels.
# This is the pixel staircase: one segment has only a few possible grid directions,
# regardless of the direction of the underlying boundary.
#
# [calcMeanDirection](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grainBoundary.calcMeanDirection.html) uses a window along each chain
# and never crosses a junction. An argument of 4 includes four neighbouring segments on
# each side of the segment.

# %%
meanDirection = gB_Mg.calcMeanDirection(4)
meanAxisTraceAngle = angle(meanDirection, axes) / degree
plot(gB_Mg, meanAxisTraceAngle, lineWidth=4, micronbar='off')
mtexColorbar(title='axis-to-mean-trace angle (°)')

# %% [markdown]
# The flicker is suppressed, so nearby segments on one boundary now carry similar colours.
# The values differ from boundary to boundary, which is the information the flicker was
# hiding. The median angle is 43.2 degrees, and 10.5 percent of the segments lie below 20
# degrees. The misorientation axes are therefore mostly not aligned with the traces in
# this section.

# %%
print(f'median axis-trace angle {np.median(meanAxisTraceAngle):.4f}, fraction below 20 degrees {np.mean(meanAxisTraceAngle < 20):.4f}')

# %% [markdown]
# Be careful with what follows from that comparison. A trace is not a plane. It is the one
# direction of the boundary plane revealed by the section, while the inclination remains
# unknown. An axis parallel to the trace lies in the boundary plane and identifies a tilt
# boundary. A large angle to the trace settles nothing on its own.
# [Twist and Tilt](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TiltAndTwistBoundaries_py.html) takes this further.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Where a segment is
#
# `midPoint` gives the segment position as a [vector3d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.vector3d.html). It
# supplies the anchor for quantities drawn at a segment, such as the misorientation axes
# computed above.

# [Select Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundarySelect_py.html) develops this indexing pattern for other
# per-segment properties.
#
# Two lengths are easy to confuse. `len(gB_Mg)` is the number of segments, whereas
# [segLength](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grainBoundary.segLength.html) contains the length of each segment in µm.
# Their sum is the total length of the selected boundary list.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Chains and connected components
#
# A chain stops at a junction. A *connected component* does not: it contains every segment
# reachable through touching segments, including branches through junctions. One component
# can therefore contain several chains.
#
# `componentId` labels each connected group. `componentSize` repeats the number of
# segments in that component on every row. It is a segment count, not a geometric length.
#
# The next example first selects segments close to the magnesium twin relation, then
# colours each segment by the size of its component.

# ## A component-scale straightness descriptor
#
# A simple straightness descriptor divides the maximum distance between two component

# ## Technical Details
#
# `grains['id', 9]` addresses a grain by its id, MATLAB's `grains('id', 9)`. The inclusion
# the page follows is grain 4 inside grain 42 in MATLAB's reconstruction and grain 9 inside
# grain 1 here; the two segmentations number their grains differently. `ebsd['id', M]` returns one measurement per entry of the matrix `M`, in its
# shape, so the two columns of `ebsdId` are the two sides of every segment.
# The two sides of a segment are its grains in the order of their ids, so the misorientation
# of the first segment of the inclusion runs from the host to the inclusion here and is the
# inverse of MATLAB's. `ebsd['id', M]` lists its rows in the shape of `M`, row by row,
# where MATLAB lists the first column and then the second.
# `componentId` counts from one, so a value indexes its component's entry at
# `componentId - 1`. MATLAB's `table` is a printed line.
