# # Anisotropic Elasticity
#
# An anisotropic material responds differently when the loading direction
# changes. A single elastic modulus can therefore describe only one loading
# geometry.
#
# The fourth-order stiffness tensor $C$ collects the complete linear elastic
# response. MTEX represents it as a
# [stiffnessTensor](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/stiffnessTensor.stiffnessTensor.html).
# This page loads one measured tensor, applies Hooke's law, and then queries
# its response for chosen directions and planes.

# ## Load the olivine stiffness tensor
#
# A stiffness tensor can be constructed from a symmetric 6-by-6 matrix.
# It can also be imported from a file, as in this example.
# The data are the olivine measurements of Abramson et al. (1997).

# %%

# orthorhombic crystal symmetry and crystal frame
cs = crystalFrame('mmm', [4.7646, 10.2296, 5.9942], mineral='Olivine')

# stiffness tensor in GPa
C = stiffnessTensor.load(fname, cs)

# A general anisotropic stiffness has as many as 21 independent numbers.
# The orthorhombic symmetry of olivine reduces this matrix to nine.
# The zero entries in the displayed matrix are imposed by that symmetry.
# The two-number isotropic limit was developed in
# [Isotropic Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/IsotropicTheory_py.html).

# ## Apply Hooke's law
#
# Stress is force per unit area, including its direction on each plane.
# Strain records the corresponding fractional change of shape.
# Linear elasticity maps a given strain to stress with $C$.
#
# Start with a diagonal strain tensor.

# Hooke's law is the double contraction of stiffness and strain.

# ## Compute the elastic energy

# The elastic energy of this strain can be computed in three equivalent

# ## Young's modulus by loading direction
#
# [Isotropic Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/IsotropicTheory_py.html) defines Young's modulus as the
# ratio of axial stress to axial strain.
# In an anisotropic crystal it depends on the loading direction $d$.
# Passing one direction to
# [YoungsModulus](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/stiffnessTensor.YoungsModulus.html) returns one value.

# %%
d = vector3d.X
E_x = C.YoungsModulus(d)
E_x

# %% [markdown]
# Omitting $d$ returns the complete directional dependence as a function on
# the sphere.

# Each point on the hemisphere is a possible loading direction.
# The changing colours and non-circular contours show why one Young's
# modulus cannot describe this crystal.

# ## Linear compressibility by direction
#
# Linear compressibility is the fractional length change along a direction
# caused by an increase in hydrostatic pressure.
# Contracting the compliance tensor with the pressure gives a second-rank
# tensor, whose directional values form another spherical function.
#
# [linearCompressibility](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/stiffnessTensor.linearCompressibility.html)
# returns that function when the direction is omitted.

# %% [markdown]
# The map answers a different question from Young's modulus.
# It shows the length response to pressure applied from every direction,
# rather than the axial response to one uniaxial load.

# Evaluate the function along the same $x$ direction.

# ## Poisson's ratio around a pulling direction
#
# [Isotropic Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/IsotropicTheory_py.html) defines Poisson's ratio from the
# axial and transverse strains.
# An anisotropic value needs a pulling direction $p$ and a transverse
# direction $n$ perpendicular to it.

# %%
# pulling direction
p = vector3d.Z

# two transverse directions
n = cat(vector3d.X, vector3d.Y)

# one value for each transverse direction
nu_xy = C.PoissonRatio(p, n)
nu_xy

# %% [markdown]
# Omitting $n$ from [PoissonRatio](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/stiffnessTensor.PoissonRatio.html)
# leaves a spherical function of possible transverse directions.

# %%
nu = C.PoissonRatio(p)
nu

# %% [markdown]
# Only directions perpendicular to $p$ are physically meaningful.
# A [section plot](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2Fun.plotSection.html) restricts the function to that
# plane, which is the $xy$ plane for the chosen $z$ pulling direction.

# Read around the circle rather than across its interior.
# The colour change around the circle shows that transverse contraction
# depends on which perpendicular direction is observed.

# ## Shear modulus for a plane and direction
#
# [Isotropic Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/IsotropicTheory_py.html) defines the shear modulus as the
# ratio of shear stress to shear strain.
# An anisotropic value needs the normal $h$ of the shear plane and a shear
# direction $u$ within that plane.
#
# Passing both directions to
# [shearModulus](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/stiffnessTensor.shearModulus.html) returns one number.

# %%
# unit shear-plane normal
h = Miller(0, 0, 1, cs).normalize()

# unit shear direction within that plane
u = Miller(1, 0, 0, cs, 'uvw').normalize()

G = C.shearModulus(h, u)

# %% [markdown]
# Omitting the shear direction leaves a spherical function of $u$.
# Only directions within the shear plane are meaningful.
# Plot a section for each of three different plane normals.

# %% [markdown]
# The common colour range makes the three sections directly comparable.
# Both the colour variation within a circle and the differences between
# circles belong to the anisotropic shear response.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The maths behind the shear modulus
#
# Write the compliance tensor as $S=C^{-1}$.
# For a unit plane normal $h$ and a perpendicular unit direction $u$, the
# directional shear modulus is
#
# $$G(h,u)=\frac{1}{4\,S_{ijkl}\,h_i u_j h_k u_l}.$$
#
# Fixing $h$ while varying $u$ gives the section plots above.
# Passing both directions evaluates the same expression as a number.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB's `:` is `colon`, and the olivine file of MATLAB's data folder is the data set
# `olivine1997`. The loader reads the density 3.355 g/cm$^3$ the file states, which MATLAB's
# numeric interface leaves out. `C.YoungsModulus()` and `C.PoissonRatio(p)` return the
# directional functions as handles evaluated on demand, where MATLAB expands them into
# harmonics of bandwidth 250 and 16; `linearCompressibility` is the same handle, MATLAB's a
# harmonic expansion of bandwidth 2. The values agree. MATLAB's section titles read 100,
# 110 and 111 because its TeX interpreter swallows the braces of `{100}`.
