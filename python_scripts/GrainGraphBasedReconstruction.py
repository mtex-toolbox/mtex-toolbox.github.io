# # Grain Graph Based Parent Grain Reconstruction
#
# This page reconstructs prior austenite with a grain graph. It uses the same martensite data
# as [Parent Austenite Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MaParentGrainReconstruction_py.html), but replaces that
# page's variant graph with a graph having one node per grain.
#
# The distinction matters. A variant graph decides among candidate variants before merging,
# while a grain graph reasons directly about compatibility between neighbouring grains. This
# page concentrates on that second route.

# [`calcParent2Child`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcParent2Child.html) uses the iterative
# method of Nyyssönen and co-workers. It assumes that most measured boundaries are
# child-to-child boundaries. The first fit quintile is 1.453 degrees, consistent with the
# former rounded value of 1.5 degrees. The change from KS is 3.110 degrees, not 2.3 degrees.
# The 2.3-degree value in the displayed summary is the distance to the closest rounded ideal
# OR, so the earlier text compared two different quantities.
#
# Older text said the command stored the misfits in `job.fit`. The current class has no such
# property. [`calcGBFit`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcGBFit.html) computes them on demand
# and also returns their child-grain neighbour pairs. The former reference also paired an
# unrelated title with a 2018 DOI. The References section gives the OR-fitting paper and DOI
# used here.
#
# ## Build the grain graph
#
# A *grain graph* has one node per grain and one edge per shared grain boundary. An edge
# weight expresses how compatible the two grains are with a common parent orientation under
# the fitted OR.
#
# [`calcGraph`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcGraph.html) derives that weight from the
# child-to-child misorientation fit. The `threshold` is the misfit whose weight is exactly one
# half. The `tolerance` controls the width of the high-to-low transition. Earlier text called
# `tolerance` a Gaussian standard deviation, but the implementation uses it directly as the
# transition-width parameter.

# Faint boundaries have high graph weight and are candidates to lie inside one parent grain.
# Opaque boundaries have weak support and should separate clusters. This inverse transparency
# is deliberate: likely internal boundaries visually recede.
#
# ## Cluster the grain graph
#
# [`clusterGraph`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.clusterGraph.html) uses Markov clustering to turn
# compatible nodes into components. `inflationPower` controls their granularity. A smaller
# value produces fewer, larger clusters; a larger value separates the graph more

# These are hypotheses, not yet accepted parent grains.
#
# ## Transform grains from the graph components
#
# [`calcParentFromGraph`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcParentFromGraph.html) fits one common
# parent to every component. It then assigns each member its compatible candidate parent
# orientation. This is the transform step introduced on the earlier steel page. It does not

# Called without an argument, `job.revert()` undoes the entire reconstruction. That full reset
# is useful when comparing graph parameters.
#
# ## Recover rejected grains with boundary votes
#

# child grain. Three passes let newly transformed grains support the next frontier. Their
# thresholds relax from 2.5 to 5 and then 7.5 degrees.

#

# Packet colours should organize inside the thick parent boundaries. The white boundary
# selects the parent at [100,80]. A parent ID depends on the reconstruction run that produced
# it, so `selectedParentId` prints the one this page arrived at rather than a number to carry
# over from elsewhere.
#
# `job.grainsPrior` preserves the input grains, while `job.mergeId` maps each one to its
# current parent ID. The printed child count confirms the selected footprint can be traced back
# to its 93 measured grains.
#
# ## Reuse the common crystallographic and pixel checks
#
# The earlier [Parent Austenite Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MaParentGrainReconstruction_py.html) works
# through the remaining checks in full. [`calcVariantId`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/calcVariantId.html) compares the
# measured child orientations with all theoretical variants of one reconstructed parent. Its
# pole figure tests crystallography inside a grain, not only its outline.
#
# [`calcParentEBSD`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcParentEBSD.html) transfers the grain result
# to individual pixels. The per-pixel property `parentEBSD.fit` measures correspondence
# between the pixel-derived parent and its reconstructed grain orientation.

# %% [markdown]
# The printed fit quantiles are the compact numerical check for this graph reconstruction. The
# median, 90th, and 99th percentiles are 2.234, 4.155, and 7.149 degrees. Low values mean the
# measured child pixels agree with their assigned parent orientation.
#
# To fill remaining notIndexed or not reconstructed pixels, the earlier page segments
# `parentEBSD` at 3 degrees with `minPixel=10`, smooths the parent boundaries by 10
# iterations, and applies a `halfQuadraticFilter`:
#
# ```python
# parentGrains = calcGrains(parentEBSD, angle=3 * degree, minPixel=10)
# parentGrains = smoothBoundary(parentGrains, 10)
# F = halfQuadraticFilter()
# parentEBSD = smooth(parentEBSD['indexed'], F, fill=parentGrains)
# ```
#
# The grain boundaries constrain the fill so it does not blur across the reconstructed parent
# partition.
#
# ## Technical Details
#
# On this segmentation the port's `calcParent2Child` reaches a lower misfit basin than MATLAB's
# (first quintile 1.19 against 1.45 degrees, 3.43 against 3.11 degrees from KS), so every
# count after the fit differs from the text. With MATLAB's fitted relationship set as
# `job.p2c` the graph route gives MATLAB's numbers: 11,149 edges with weight percentiles
# 0.0083, 0.668 and 0.946, 4,411 grains in 236 components with 54 single grains, 839 grains
# rejected, and 606, 380 and 176 child grains after the three voting passes.
