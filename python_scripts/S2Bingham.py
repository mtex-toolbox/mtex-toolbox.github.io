# # The Spherical Bingham Distribution
#
# The Bingham distribution is a compact model for axes on the sphere. An axis has no
# preferred sign, so its density is *antipodally symmetric*: the directions $\mathbf{v}$ and
# $-\mathbf{v}$ always have the same value. This makes the model useful when measurements
# describe lines or planes rather than signed vectors.
#
# The preceding [Harmonic Representation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunHarmonicRepresentation_py.html) page used many
# coefficients to describe a general shape. A Bingham distribution instead uses three
# perpendicular principal axes and three concentration parameters.

# ## Construct one Bingham distribution
#
# MTEX stores the concentration parameters as `Z = [z1, z2, z3]`. Adding the same constant
# to all three parameters does not change the normalized density, so the largest is
# conventionally set to zero. The other two are nonpositive.
#
# The `vector3d` array `a` contains three perpendicular principal axes. A random rotation
# below turns the coordinate axes together while preserving their orthogonality.

# %%
Z = [-10, -4, 0]

# The density has equal maxima at the two ends of `a[2]` because its third concentration
# parameter is zero. The value decreases more rapidly toward `a[0]` than toward `a[1]`
# because -10 is more negative than -4. The contours around each maximum are therefore
# elongated rather than circular.

quadratureMean

# %% [markdown]
# MTEX scales a Bingham density to a mean value of one over the sphere. The port computes
# its normalization constant exactly, as a hypergeometric function of the matrix argument,
# so the mean is one. Sampling and the locations of the contours do not depend on this
# constant.
#
# ## How the concentration parameters change the shape
#
# The next grid uses `Z = [-k1, -k2, 0]` with nonnegative magnitudes $k_1\geq k_2$. The five
# values 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 show the transition from a uniform density to point maxima and
# girdles.
#
# Equal values $k_1=k_2>0$ give rotationally symmetric point maxima around the third axis.
# Setting $k_2=0$ leaves a *girdle*: a band around the great circle perpendicular to the
# first axis.

# Read the grid from the uniform case at $k_1=k_2=0$. Along the diagonal, both
# concentrations grow together and the two point maxima narrow. Along the $k_2=0$ row,
# increasing $k_1$ sharpens the girdle. Intermediate pairs produce elliptical contours
# between those two limiting shapes. Blank cells omit the redundant cases with $k_1<k_2$.

# ## Draw a random sample

# proportional to the density.

# The directions cluster around both antipodal maxima and spread farther along the broad
# axis of the contours. The sample represents undirected axes even though each plotted point

# ## Fit a Bingham distribution to directions
#
# Given arbitrarily scattered directions, [fit](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunBingham.fit.html) estimates the
# principal axes and concentrations of the best-fitting Bingham distribution. With
# `confidenceEllipse=True` it also returns the uncertainty in the fitted modal axis.

# %% [markdown]
# The fitted contours follow the same elongated cloud as the observations. The red marker
# selects `bingFunEst.a[2]` as one representative of the antipodal modal axis. The black
# ellipse is the default 95 percent confidence region for that fitted axis, not the spread
# of the density. The fitted `Z` lies close to the generating values [-10, -4, 0]; with
# 50 random directions it varies from one sample to the next, and so do the semi-axes of the
# ellipse, a few degrees each.
#
# The method documentation calls this the confidence ellipse of the mean direction. For an
# antipodally symmetric distribution the vector mean vanishes, so *modal axis* is the more
# precise description. The values `ab[0]` and `ab[1]` are ellipse semi-axis lengths in
# radians. The rotation `rot` places that ellipse in the tangent plane.
#
# ## The maths behind the Bingham density
#
# Let $A$ be the orthogonal matrix whose columns are the principal axes and let
# $Z=\mathrm{diag}(z_1,z_2,z_3)$. The probability density with respect to spherical surface
# area is
#
# $$ p_B(\mathbf{x}\mid A,Z) =
# \frac{1}{F(Z)}\exp\!\left(\mathbf{x}^{T}AZA^{T}\mathbf{x}\right). $$
#
# The factor $F(Z)$ is the exact surface-area normalization. MTEX multiplies this
# probability density by $4\pi$ to use its usual mean-one density convention. Because
# $\mathbf{x}^{T}\mathbf{x}=1$, adding a constant to every $z_j$ multiplies the numerator by
# one constant that normalization removes. MTEX therefore uses $z_1\leq z_2\leq z_3=0$ for
# the examples on this page.
#
# The matrix $A$ has previously been called an orthogonal covariance matrix. More precisely,
# it is the orthogonal matrix of principal axes. The symmetric matrix $AZA^T$ is the
# concentration matrix in specimen coordinates.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB approximates the normalization constant by a saddle point and reports a mean of
# 1.0377 for these parameters; the port's is exact. MATLAB's fit solves for `Z` with the
# same approximation, the port's exactly. MATLAB's second and third outputs of `fit` are
# `confidenceEllipse=True` here; `a[2]` is MATLAB's `a(3)`.
