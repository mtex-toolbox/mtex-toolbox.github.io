# # Lists and Indexing
#
# Almost every MTEX variable is a list of objects of one kind. An [EBSD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.EBSD.html)
# variable is a list of measurements, a [grain2d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.grain2d.html) variable is a list
# of grains, and `grains.boundary` is a list of grain boundary segments. An
# [orientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.orientation.html) variable commonly stores a list of
# orientations.
#
# There is no separate type for one grain. A single grain is a `grain2d` list with length
# one.
#
# Two consequences account for most list operations in MTEX.
#
# * An elementwise function or property acts on every list element. It usually returns one
#   result per element: `grains.area` gives one area per grain, and `ori.angle()` gives one
#   angle per orientation. Reduction functions such as `mean` are exceptions because they
#   combine several elements into one result. Loops are therefore almost never needed for
#   elementwise calculations.
# * Square bracket indexing selects elements as it does for a NumPy array. The result is a
#   list of the same kind, so an operation that accepts the complete list also accepts the
#   selection.
#
# The diagram compares the two main forms of indexing. Position indices pick specified list
# entries in the requested order. A logical condition keeps the entries whose mask value is
# true.
#

#
# The sections that follow show the indexing itself on plain numbers, for clarity. The same
# two forms then apply unchanged to any MTEX list.

# ## Make a list
#
# `np.array` creates a list by placing values next to one another.

# %%
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
x

# %% [markdown]
# `np.arange` is shorthand for a regularly spaced range. With no step specified, it uses a
# step of one. Its end is exclusive, so the range 1 to 10 is `np.arange(1, 11)`.

# %%
x = np.arange(1, 11)
x

# %% [markdown]
# ## Apply an operation to every element
#
# NumPy applies arithmetic operations elementwise. `x**2` squares every element of `x`
# independently; a matrix power is `np.linalg.matrix_power`.

# %%
y = x**2
y

# %% [markdown]
# ## Select by position
#
# A list of positions selects those elements in the given order. Here, `ind` selects the
# first, third, and fifth squared values. Python counts positions from zero, so the first
# element has position 0.

# %%
ind = [0, 2, 4]
ind

# %%
y[ind]

# %% [markdown]
# ## Select by condition
#
# A condition evaluated for the complete list returns one logical value per element. A
# logical value is either true or false. It can be used as an index to retain only the
# corresponding true entries.

# %%
cond = x % 2 == 0
cond

# %%
y[cond]

# %% [markdown]
# The condition tests which values in `x` are even. Using the same mask to index `y`
# returns their squares. This works because `x` and `y` have the same length and order.
#
# ## Use the same pattern with MTEX objects
#
# Nearly every MTEX selection has the same form. For example,
# `grains[grains.area > 100]` selects grains with area greater than 100,
# `ebsd[ebsd.mad < 1]` selects measurements with a mean angular deviation below 1, and
# `gB[gB.misorientation.angle() > 10*degree]` selects grain boundary segments with a
# misorientation angle greater than 10 degrees.
#
# In each expression, MTEX computes one property value per object. The comparison turns
# those values into a logical mask, and the brackets apply the mask to the original list.
#
# MTEX also provides two domain-specific selectors. A phase name selects all measurements of
# that phase, as in `ebsd['Forsterite']`. For spatial data, a position selects the object
# found there, as in `grains(x, y)`. See [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html)
# for spatial grain selections.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB counts from one and its ranges `1:10` include the end; Python counts from zero and
# `np.arange(1, 11)` excludes it. The values and the selections are MATLAB's, the positions
# one less. A map read from a regular grid is a two-dimensional list in the port, so
# `ebsd[ebsd.mad < 1]` returns the selected measurements as a one-dimensional list, as NumPy
# does for a boolean mask.
