#
# A VPSC simulation can record how a polycrystal's orientations and slip activity change
# with strain. This page imports both histories and shows how to compare their
# deformation steps in MTEX.
#
# [VPSC](https://public.lanl.gov/lebenso/) is a crystal-plasticity code originally
# written by Ricardo Lebensohn and Carlos Tomé at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The
# original code can be requested from lebenso@lanl.gov.

# ## Import the texture history
#
# A VPSC run usually writes `TEX_PH1.OUT` for phase 1. The file contains one block of
# weighted orientations for each recorded strain level. It does not contain crystal
# symmetry, so supply that information first.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('222', [4.762, 10.225, 5.994], mineral='olivine')

# %% [markdown]
# [`SO3Fun.load`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.load.html) reads each block and estimates an
# [orientation distribution function](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html) (ODF) from its weighted
# orientations. The `halfwidth` is the smoothing width of that estimate; it is not a
# parameter read from VPSC.

path2file = os.path.join(mtexDataPath(), 'VPSC')

# A file with several blocks returns a list with one ODF per block. This sample contains
# nine ODFs. Its first eight steps run from strain 0.25 to 2.00, and the final block is
# another result at strain 2.00.

# ## Inspect one deformation step
#
# Index the list to select one ODF. A sigma-section plot exposes the three-dimensional
# orientation density as a sequence of two-dimensional sections.

# %% [markdown]
# The section maxima identify the preferred orientations at strain 0.50. Their unequal
# intensities show that this simulated texture is already far from a uniform orientation
# distribution.
#
# VPSC header values and the original orientation table remain available in `opt`. The
# fields below contain the strain, the phase-ellipsoid axes and angles, the 1000 imported
# orientations, and the three extra numeric columns from this file.

# %%

# ## File conventions and input weight files
#
# The same command reads weight files with the `.wts` extension that are handed *to*
# VPSC. It also reads files written by `export(ori, fname, 'VPSC')`. Those files carry
# neither strain nor a phase ellipsoid, so the corresponding `odf.opt` entries are `NaN`.
#
# The fourth header line names the Euler-angle convention. VPSC uses `B` for Bunge, `K`
# for Kocks, and `R` for Roe, and MTEX follows the convention announced by each file.

# ## Compare pole figures during deformation
#
# A pole figure plots where selected crystal directions lie in the specimen. Plotting the
# same directions at successive strain levels makes the texture evolution visible without
# comparing full ODF section plots.

# Read the rows from top to bottom as strain increases from 0.25 to 1.00. The shared
# colour range makes intensities comparable between rows; the changing peak positions and
# strengths are therefore texture evolution, not independent plot scaling.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Visualize slip-system activity
#
# VPSC also writes `ACT_PH1.OUT` alongside the orientation data. It contains the activity
# of the different slip modes during deformation. Read it as a table with named columns so
# its `STRAIN` and `MODE1` through `MODE9` columns retain their names.

# Plot every mode against strain. `AVACS` is the second column and is not a slip mode, so
# the loop begins at the third column.

# Modes 1-3 dominate this simulation. Mode 3 rises to its maximum near strain 1, mode 2
# steadily weakens, and mode 1 nearly catches mode 3 at the final step. To inspect a
# single mode as a smooth curve, for example mode 3, one can fit
# `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline(ACT['STRAIN'], ACT['MODE3'])` and plot it.
