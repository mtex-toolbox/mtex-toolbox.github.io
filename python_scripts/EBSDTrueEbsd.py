# # TrueEBSD Distortion Correction
#
# An EBSD map and an SEM image of the same area never quite line up: the beam drifts during
# the scan, the camera moves between acquisitions, the specimen is tilted. TrueEBSD corrects
# that, so every pixel of the map and every pixel of the images refers to the same point on
# the specimen. What comes out is an ordinary EBSD map that carries the images as per-pixel
# properties.
#
# TrueEBSD was first published as a separate toolbox by Vivian Tong and Stefan Olovsjö of
# Seco Tools AB, R&D Materials and Technology, Fagersta, Sweden. Tong et al. describe its
# MTEX implementation and correlative applications in
# [arXiv 2605.00703](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.00703).
#
# This page runs the whole workflow on a cut-down WC-Co dataset in well under a minute.
# First read [Maps and Images](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDMapsAndImages_py.html) to prepare a common specimen frame,
# array layout and length unit. See [Spatial Transforms](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSpatialTransform_py.html) for
# choosing a distortion model, [trueEbsd](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/trueEbsd.trueEbsd.html) for the workflow class and
# [mapImage](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/mapImage.mapImage.html) for its image container.
#
# TrueEBSD corrects map positions. It does not repair an incorrect relation between Euler
# angles and the specimen frame, and it does not correct an orientation error caused during
# acquisition. Use [Reference Frame Alignment](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) for the first
# problem.
#
# The convention set here only decides which way up the figures come out. It has no effect
# on the correction: a map entry's array order is read off its own `d1` and `d2`, and no
# plotting convention is consulted anywhere in the workflow.

# The structure lists four same-area SEM images and their pixel size. The EBSD map itself
# supplies the fifth image below through its band contrast.
#
# ## Build the Sequence
#
# TrueEBSD does not jump straight from the EBSD map to the reference image. It steps through
# the images one pair at a time, correcting one kind of distortion at each step - which is
# why there are four images rather than one. Each pair differs by something simple enough to
# model, whereas the map and the final image differ by everything at once.
#
# The order therefore matters. It runs from the *most* distorted map to the ground-truth
# reference. The images go in one list and the distortions in another, one per hop. The last
# image is the fixed reference and does not move.
#
# `name` is what each image is called once it is attached to the map at the end, so the
# result reads as `ebsdOut.fsdT1`.

# A light box filter first - cross-correlation dislikes noise - and one common range, since

# The distortions are objects, one per *hop*, not names on the images: beam drift plus a
# rigid offset, then nothing, then the camera moving, then the specimen tilt seen at a
# different kV. There are five maps and so four hops, and the reference has no entry of its
# own - where nothing separates a pair that is `spatialTransformId`.
#
# A multi-stage model is built with `+` and not `*`. `+` reads left to right in the order
# the stages are applied and keeps both of them, where an unfitted prototype has zero
# coefficients, so it reports itself as the identity and `*` would absorb it away.

# Plot the sequence to check the images really do cover the same area. Note how different

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# The same WC grain network is visible in every panel, but its edges do not yet occupy the
# same positions. Each hop displaces the map in its own direction, and those directions
# partly cancel along the chain: the shifts fitted below come to about (3.9, 5.5) pixels for
# the first hop and (-2.8, -1.9) for the third, which leaves the last panel closer to the
# first than the first two panels are to each other.
#
# ## Put Everything on One Pixel Grid
#
# The map is on a 0.159 µm grid and the images on 0.0795 µm. `pixelSizeMatch` resamples them
# all onto the finest one, so pixel (i, j) means roughly the same place in each. Give it a
# pixel size to ask for a particular grid; with no argument it takes the smallest present.
#
# Images are interpolated linearly. EBSD data is not: orientations and phase labels have no
# meaningful average, so the nearest measured point is used.
#
# Nothing has been corrected yet - this is only bookkeeping.

# %%
job.pixelSizeMatch()

# %% [markdown]
# The resampled sequence is in `job.resizedList`.

# %%
job.resizedList

# %% [markdown]
# ## Adjust the Matching Windows
#
# Distortions are measured by cutting both images of a pair into small boxes and
# cross-correlating each box with its partner - see [xcfShift](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/xcfShift.html). That gives a
# local shift at each box, and those shifts are fitted to the distortion model.
#
# Almost none of it has to be specified. The box width `roiSize` and the `edgeWidth` below
# are measured from the images themselves the first time `calcDistortion` needs them, and
# what was chosen is printed so it can be overridden. Both are *lengths*, in the map's own
# `scanUnit`, so they mean the same thing before and after `pixelSizeMatch` and may be set at
# any point.
#
# What is worth setting here is how many boxes to use. The default of 24 across suits a
# full-size map; this grid is small, and the matching is the entire runtime, so fewer is
# quicker.

# %%
job.setOptions(numROI=16)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Measure the Distortion
#
# These are the pictures that will actually be matched. A band contrast map and a
# backscatter image have nothing in common as grey values, but their grain boundaries fall
# in the same places - which is why the edge transform is what gets correlated, and why
# `registerOn` defaults to `'edge'`. Set it to `'raw'` for a pair that already shares
# contrast.

# %%
plot(job.resizedList, edge=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Corresponding WC boundaries now appear as bright lines in every panel. Those shared lines,
# rather than the detector-dependent grey levels, are what each local cross-correlation
# window matches.
#
# `'fitErr'` re-measures the shifts *after* each correction and reports what is left over.
# That residual is how you tell whether it worked: around a pixel or less is good.
#
# Both columns read as a length followed by the signed x and y behind it, in pixels of the
# common grid: how far the step moved the map, and which way. Where the length and signed
# components agree, the correction was one coherent movement - a specimen drift or a camera
# offset has a direction. Where the signed pair falls to nearly zero against a large length,
# the boxes disagree with each other and the correlation found no common direction.
#
# If a residual comes out above two pixels, TrueEBSD doubles the box size and tries again,
# repeating until it comes down or the box outgrows the image. On the first hop here, the
# automatic 32 px box leaves 3.36 px and triggers one 64 px retry. The residual then falls
# to 1.53 px.
#
# Steps whose transform is `spatialTransformId` are skipped: nothing separates that pair, so
# their shift is taken as zero. The displayed `difference` for that hop is the raw image
# difference, not a fitted residual and not a correction to apply.

# Afterwards `job.T` holds the *fitted* transforms rather than the prototypes it started
# from.

# ## Correct It
#
# Each map is now moved by the shifts of every step between it and the reference. The
# reference itself does not move.
#
# Resampling is nearest-neighbour throughout, so no orientation and no phase label is ever
# invented by averaging two real measurements.

# %%
job.undistort()

plot(job.undistortedList)

# %% [markdown]
# The outer rectangle was already shared: `pixelSizeMatch` put every entry on the same grid
# and the same extent. What has changed is inside it. The same WC boundaries now occupy the
# same positions from the band-contrast map through to the fixed reference. Small intensity
# differences remain because alignment does not make the detectors measure the same signal.
#
# ## Use the Result
#
# Every image is now attached to the EBSD map as a per-pixel property, under the `name`
# given earlier. So `ebsdOut.fsdT1` is just another map property, and
# `plot(ebsdOut, ebsdOut.fsdT1)` works like any other plot. It needs no conversion and stays
# with the map through cropping, gridding and indexing.
#
# Plotting them back onto the map is also the quickest check that nothing came out the wrong
# way round.
#
# `fsdB3` is a colour image and keeps all three channels. Plotting onto a map needs one value
# per pixel, so it is averaged to grey here.

# The orientation panel below is coloured by the inverse pole figure of `zvector`. This page
# draws y downwards, and that convention puts z into the screen, which the axes inset in each

#
# ## Finish
#
# The map and the images now overlay pixel for pixel, and `ebsdOut` is an ordinary EBSD map
# that happens to carry four SEM images as properties. Anything you would normally do with a
# map works from here - including turning a thresholded image into a phase.
#
# `trueEbsdWCCoSmall` is the centre half of the full WC-Co field of view coarsened by four: a
# 20.4 × 15.3 µm area with WC grains about 12 px across. It is small enough to be quick and
# still large enough for every distortion to be measurable. The full dataset is
# `trueEbsdWCCo`, and the same script runs on it unchanged - it simply takes minutes rather
# than seconds.

# ## Next
#
# The aligned SEM channels can now take part in normal EBSD analysis. For example, continue
# with [grain reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) before measuring phase fractions,
# contiguity or boundary-conditioned image signals. Use [Denoising](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDDenoising_py.html) only
# for orientation noise; denoising and spatial distortion correction solve different
# problems.
#
# ## Technical Details
#
# Every number of this run is MATLAB's: the measured settings, the shifts and residuals of the
# table, every tile's shift to the last digit, the resampled and undistorted images and the
# phases and orientations of `ebsdOut` (`bench/matlab/probe_trueebsd.m`). The WC-Co data set
# is read from an HDF5 file of plain arrays that `bench/matlab/export_trueebsd.m` writes from
# MATLAB's `.mat`, hosted in the MTEX data repository. The map's `opt` is `ebsd.meta` here.
