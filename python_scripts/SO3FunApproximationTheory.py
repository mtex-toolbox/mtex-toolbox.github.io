# # Approximating Orientation-Dependent Functions from Discrete Data
#
# Suppose that a quantity has been measured at orientations $\mathtt{ori}_m$, with one value
# $v_m$ at each orientation. The task is to replace those samples by a function that can be
# evaluated and plotted at any orientation. MTEX calls this operation `interp`, although the
# fitted function need not pass through every sample exactly.
#
# The values may be an orientation distribution function (ODF), such as volume fractions
# measured at different orientations. They may instead be any scalar physical property that
# depends on orientation. This distinction determines whether the fitted function must be
# nonnegative and have mean 1.

# ## Importing the samples
#
# An ASCII file can contain one orientation and one or more measured values per row.
# [loadOrientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.load.html) needs the columns of the Euler angles and the
# names of the additional columns.

# %%
fname = mtexdatafile('dubnaValues')
ori, S = loadOrientation(fname, columnNames=['phi1', 'Phi', 'phi2', 'values'])

# %% [markdown]
# The result `ori` contains the sample orientations. The table `S` has one column for every
# additional column of the file, so the values in this file are available as `S['values']`.

# %%
plotSection(ori, S['values'], 'sigma', all=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Each marker in the section plot is one sample, and its colour is the corresponding value.
# Notice the isolated high-value regions and the large areas with values close to zero. A
# useful approximation should retain those regions without introducing unsupported
# oscillations.
#
# ## Choosing an approximation
#
# Approximation finds a function that agrees reasonably well with the data. Interpolation is
# the special case in which it agrees exactly at the sample orientations. Noise, incomplete
# sampling, or regularisation often makes approximation the more useful goal.
#
# [interp](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/rotation.interp.html) provides three approximation schemes:
#
# * A harmonic expansion is a global series model. Prefer it for a general
#   orientation-dependent relationship, especially with many nodes, outliers, or noise.
# * A radial-basis-function (RBF) model is a weighted sum of kernels centred on a grid.
#   Prefer it for an ODF with a low or medium number of nodes, and use `'density'` when
#   nonnegativity and mean 1 are required.
# * A Bingham distribution is a compact parametric density model. Use it only when one
#   Bingham-shaped component is physically appropriate.
#
# These are starting points rather than rules. In practice, compare the computational cost
# and the fitted shapes from both harmonic and RBF models. The residual at the samples is
# useful, but it cannot by itself reveal oscillations or overfitting between them.
#
# ## Harmonic approximation
#
# The flag `'harmonic'` selects a harmonic expansion. Internally, `interp` calls
# [SO3FunHarmonic.interpolate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunHarmonic.interpolate.html). The default fit includes
# regularisation, which suppresses rapidly varying harmonic coefficients.

# Compare this plot with the discrete samples. The strongest regions remain in the same
# sections, while regularisation rounds their peaks and prevents the fit from following
# every local variation.
#
# The default regularisation parameter is $\lambda=10^{-8}$. Setting it to zero switches
# regularisation off and asks the harmonic model to follow the samples more closely.

# A converged unregularized solution is free to make the residual much smaller, but it can
# create narrow peaks and ripples between the samples. Do not interpret an unconverged
# residual as the optimum. Even after convergence, a smaller residual is not by itself
# evidence for a better model. The [next page](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/HarmonicApproximationTheory_py.html) explains
# how to choose regularisation and check solver convergence.
#
# Reducing the harmonic bandwidth is another form of regularisation. The bandwidth is the
# largest harmonic degree retained by the series.

# The bandwidth-16 fit cannot reproduce variations finer than its truncated series permits.
# It is smoother than the unrestricted unregularized fit, but bandwidth alone does not
# enforce the physical constraints of an ODF. In particular, harmonic approximation cannot
# guarantee a nonnegative function even when every supplied value is nonnegative.

# ## Density-constrained RBF approximation
#
# Without a method flag, `interp` uses an RBF model and internally calls
# [SO3FunRBF.interpolate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunRBF.interpolate.html). The `'density'` flag constrains the
# weights so that the result is nonnegative and then normalizes its mean to 1.

# The peaks follow the high-valued sample regions, while the background remains
# nonnegative. The printed minimum and mean check the two density constraints directly. The
# residual can be larger than for an unconstrained fit because those constraints remove
# otherwise admissible solutions. If the iteration limit was reached, the coefficients may
# not yet be optimal. Adjust `maxIter` or `tol` before making a quantitative comparison.
#
# The key smoothing parameter is the kernel halfwidth. A larger halfwidth blends information
# over a wider angular neighbourhood. A very small halfwidth can overfit the samples.

# %%
psi = SO3DeLaValleePoussinKernel(halfwidth=2.5 * degree)
SO3FNarrow = interp(ori, S['values'], 'density', kernel=psi, resolution=5 * degree)
plot(SO3FNarrow, 'sigma')

# %% [markdown]
# The centre spacing remains 5 degrees, so the change from the default fit comes from the
# 2.5 degree kernels. They produce narrower local features. Features that merely mirror the
# sample spacing are a warning that the halfwidth is too small. The
# [RBF theory page](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RBFApproximationTheory_py.html) develops this diagnostic and the other
# solver options.
#
# ## Unconstrained RBF approximation
#
# Omitting `'density'` solves an unconstrained least-squares problem. As in the harmonic
# setting, the result may become negative and its mean need not equal 1.

# The unconstrained plot may follow the samples more closely, but the printed minimum and

# warning applies here: validate convergence before comparing residuals.
#
# ## Fitting a Bingham distribution
#
# [SO3FunBingham.interpolate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunBingham.interpolate.html) fits the samples with one
# Bingham distribution. The flag `'bingham'` selects it through `interp`. The following
# controlled example begins with a fibre ODF and samples it on a coarse grid.

# %%
rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
cs = crystalFrame("1")
odf = fibreODF(fibre.rand(cs, rng=rng))
S3G = equispacedSO3Grid(cs, resolution=15 * degree)
v = odf.eval(S3G)

plot(odf)

# %% [markdown]
# The source ODF has a continuous ridge of high values along one fibre. A Bingham
# distribution with two large equal concentrations and one zero is exactly that girdle
# shape, so a single component describes this ODF almost perfectly.

plot(SO3FBingham)

# %% [markdown]
# The printed concentrations show the girdle case, the residual is about one percent, and
# the two plots are hard to tell apart. One Bingham component has few parameters, so a
# source whose structure a girdle cannot hold - several separated components, say - is
# where this fit would fall short.
#
# Bingham approximation currently works only for trivial symmetry. Do not use this route for
# the nontrivial symmetries: with a crystal symmetry the sample is first moved about its mean
# into one fundamental region, and the tensor of a density spread over that region is not
# the one of a Bingham distribution.
#
# ## A response that is not an ODF
#
# Density constraints are wrong for a property that may be negative or need not have mean 1.
# To make that distinction visible, consider noisy samples of
#
# $$ f(\mathbf{R}) = \cos(\omega(\mathbf{R})) \sin(3\varphi_1(\mathbf{R})) + \frac{1}{2}. $$
#
# Here $\omega(\mathbf{R})$ is the rotation angle, and $\varphi_1(\mathbf{R})$ is the first
# Euler angle of $\mathbf{R}$.

# %%
f = SO3FunHandle(lambda r: np.cos(r.angle()) * np.sin(3 * r.phi1) + 0.5)
plot(f, 'sigma')

# %% [markdown]
# The exact response contains broad positive and negative lobes. A density fit would erase
# the negative part and change the intended quantity.

ori2 = orientation.rand(100000, rng=rng)

# Fit the same 100,000 noisy samples with an unconstrained harmonic model and an

# The harmonic fit recovers the broad alternating lobes, and it follows the samples more
# closely than the noise level warrants: its values run well outside the exact range of
# $-0.5$ to $1.5$, so the global series is fitting the noise along with the signal.

# The RBF fit recovers the same sign changes through overlapping local kernels and stays
# much closer to the exact range. It reproduces the noisy samples less well and the
# underlying function better. Choose between the two by validation error on held-out
# samples and by computational cost, not by how closely each reproduces the data it was
# given.
