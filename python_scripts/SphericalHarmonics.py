# # Spherical Harmonics
#
# Spherical harmonics are standard wave-like functions on the unit sphere. They play the
# same role for a spherical function that sines and cosines play for a periodic signal. Low
# degrees describe broad variation, while higher degrees can describe progressively finer
# angular detail.
#
# MTEX uses spherical harmonics as an orthonormal basis for square-integrable functions on
# the sphere. The preceding [Harmonic Representation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunHarmonicRepresentation_py.html) page
# explains how an `S2FunHarmonic` stores and combines their coefficients. This page examines
# the basis functions themselves.

# ## Evaluate all orders of one degree
#
# A spherical harmonic is identified by its *degree* $m$ and its *order* $l$. For a fixed
# degree $m$, the order runs from $-m$ to $m$. [sphericalY](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/sphericalY.html) evaluates all
# $2m+1$ orders at once and returns them in ascending order.
#
# Here the evaluation direction is the specimen X direction. The three entries are
# $Y_1^{-1}(\mathbf{x})$, $Y_1^0(\mathbf{x})$, and $Y_1^1(\mathbf{x})$.

# ## Read the degree-one values
#
# The two outer entries are equal at this direction. The middle entry is zero up to
# floating-point round-off. Changing `v` evaluates the same three basis
# functions at another direction on the sphere.
#
# ## Select one basis function by its coefficient
#
# The coefficient vector of an `S2FunHarmonic` is ordered degree by degree. Degree zero
# occupies the first entry. The three degree-one entries then correspond to orders $-1$, 0,
# and 1. A one in the fourth position therefore selects $Y_1^1$.

# ## Compare the two evaluation routes
#
# `valueFromSeries` equals the last entry of `Y1AtX`. Use `sphericalY` when the basis
# values themselves are required. Use `S2FunHarmonic` when coefficients will be combined,
# rotated, differentiated, or integrated.
#
# ## Check the MTEX normalization
#
# Several normalizations of spherical harmonics are common in the literature. MTEX
# normalizes every basis function to unit $L^2$ norm. The norm of the port is taken for the
# normalised surface measure, so the selected basis function has norm $1/\sqrt{4\pi}$.

# ## Read the basis plot

# The constant degree-zero function is the sphere in the first panel. Degree one has one
# broad pair of lobes. Degree two changes sign more often, and the first degree-three
# function begins an even finer pattern. Radius shows magnitude, while colour distinguishes
# the signed real part. The complex orders are displayed through the real part used by
# `surf`.
#
# ## The maths behind the basis
#
# Write a point on the sphere in polar coordinates as
#
# $$ \mathbf{\xi}=(\sin\theta\cos\rho,\sin\theta\sin\rho,\cos\theta). $$
#
# In the MTEX convention, the spherical harmonic of degree $m$ and nonnegative order
# $l=0,\ldots,m$ is
#
# $$ Y_m^l(\mathbf{\xi}) = \sqrt{\frac{2m+1}{4\pi}}\,
# P_m^{l}(\cos\theta)\,\mathrm e^{\mathrm i l\rho}. $$
#
# Negative orders are completed by $Y_m^{-l}(\mathbf{\xi})=\overline{Y_m^l(\mathbf{\xi})}$.
# The associated Legendre functions are
#
# $$ P_m^l(x) = \sqrt{\frac{(m-l)!}{(m+l)!}}\,
# (1-x^2)^{l/2}\frac{\mathrm d^l}{\mathrm d x^l}P_m(x), $$
#
# where $m\in\mathbf{N}_0$. The Legendre polynomials follow Rodrigues' formula
#
# $$ P_m(x)=\frac{1}{2^m m!}\frac{\mathrm d^m}{\mathrm d x^m}
# (x^2-1)^m. $$
#
# The spherical harmonics form an orthonormal basis in $L^2(\mathbb{S}^2)$. MTEX defines the
# norm by
#
# $$ \|f\|_2=\left(\int_{\mathbb{S}^2}|f(\mathbf{\xi})|^2\,
# \mathrm d\mathbf{\xi}\right)^{1/2}. $$
#
# Consequently, $\|1\|_2^2=4\pi$ and $\|Y_m^l\|_2=1$ for every $m$ and $l$. See
# [Integration and norms](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunOperations_py.html) for integration of spherical functions.

#
# ## Technical Details
#
# `sphericalY` and the coefficients `fhat` are MTEX's, without the Condon-Shortley phase:
# $Y_m^{-l} = \overline{Y_m^l}$. The port computes internally with the phase
# (`docs/design/harmonics.md`) and converts at the boundary. The norm is that of the
# normalised measure, $1/\sqrt{4\pi}$ times MATLAB's.
