# # Volume Data and Slices
#
# An `EBSD3` object stores one measurement per voxel: its position, phase, orientation, and
# whatever properties the file provides. It is the volume counterpart of a two-dimensional
# `EBSD` map, and the representation to use while the question still concerns individual
# measurements rather than whole-grain geometry.
#
# This page imports such a volume, displays it, and cuts planar slices out of it. A slice
# is an ordinary two-dimensional EBSD map, so everything written for planar data applies to
# it unchanged. The polyhedral `grain3d` representation is the subject of
# [Three-Dimensional Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3D_py.html).

# ## Import a volume
#
# `EBSD3.load` detects the file format automatically. The sample data set is a simulated
# nine-phase volume written in the Xnovo GrainMapper3D format,
#
#     ebsd = EBSD3.load(os.path.join(mtexDataPath(), 'EBSD3', 'SimulatedMultiPhase.h5'))
#
# which `mtexdata` resolves by name.

# %%
ebsd = mtexdata('xnovo')
print(ebsd)

# %% [markdown]
# The summary reports a 50 x 50 x 50 grid rather than a list, i.e. the measurements are
# held on a lattice whose entries are addressed as `ebsd[i, j, k]`. The three array
# dimensions carry $x$, $y$ and $z$. Each of the nine phases occupies roughly a twelfth of
# the voxels and the remaining fifth is not indexed.
#
# The voxel is 10 micron on a side and the volume spans about half a millimetre in each
# direction.

# %%
print([ebsd.dx, ebsd.dy, ebsd.dz])
print(ebsd.extent())

# %% [markdown]
# ## Select voxels
#
# A phase or a condition selects voxels the way it selects the pixels of a map. The result
# is a list of the selected voxels, shorter than the volume, that still carries the unit
# cell of the grid it came from.

# %%
ebsdQuartz = ebsd['Quartz']
print(ebsdQuartz)

# %% [markdown]
# Whatever needs the grid rebuilds it in place: `calcGrains`, `plot` and `slice` put the
# list back onto its lattice, with the cells nobody occupies not indexed, and `gridify`
# does so explicitly. A block of subscripts, `ebsd[9:20, 9:20, 9:20]`, keeps the grid and
# crops it.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Display the volume
#
# `plot` shows the volume in three slice planes through its middle, the picture MATLAB's
# volume viewer opens with. The figure links to an interactive page of the same scene, and
# `show3d()` opens it in a window where it is rotated and zoomed with the mouse:
#
#     plot(ebsd)                          # colour by phase
#     plot(ebsd, ebsd.prop['grainId'])    # colour by a property

# %%
plot(ebsd)

# %% [markdown]
# Voxel colours are never interpolated, so a boundary stays where the measurement puts it,
# and voxels that are not indexed are painted in white. The planes lie at the middle voxel
# of each axis; `plot(ebsd, at=(i, j, k))` puts them elsewhere.
#
# Anything that has to end up in a figure, a publication, or a further calculation goes
# through a slice.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Cut a slice
#
# `slice` resamples the volume onto a regular grid inside a `plane3d` and returns a
# two-dimensional `EBSD` map. The plane is given by its normal and one point on it.

# %%
ebsdZ = ebsd.slice(plane3d(vector3d.Z, vector3d(0, 0, 0)))
print(ebsdZ)

# %% [markdown]
# The result is a gridded map like any imported one, it carries all nine phases, and it
# plots like one.

# %%
plot(ebsdZ)

# %% [markdown]
# The section is a disc, so the simulated specimen is round in the $xy$ plane rather than
# filling its bounding box. The grains are equiaxed and the nine phases are mixed through
# the section without any layering.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Slices at several depths
#
# Repeating the cut at different heights shows how the microstructure develops through the
# volume. Each panel is a full EBSD map.

# The three discs have the same diameter, so the specimen is a cylinder standing along
# $z$. The grain pattern is different in each panel because every section meets a
# different set of grains.

# %% [markdown]
# ## An arbitrary plane
#
# The normal is unrestricted. The measurements of a section keep their position in the
# specimen, and a map is drawn in the coordinates of the plane it lies in, so a section
# that does not lie in the $xy$ plane is drawn face on without moving any data.

# The section normal to $x$ is rectangular and shows the full height of the cylinder. The
# oblique section is the larger of the two because that plane crosses more of the
# specimen; its grid is regular within the plane, not in the specimen axes.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Several sections at once
#
# A section keeps the position its measurements have in the specimen, so drawing more than
# one into the same axes assembles them where they belong. Three orthogonal cuts seen from
# an angle give the picture the volume viewer shows, in a figure that can be published.

# %% [markdown]
# The convention a single section carries decides how that section alone is seen. Once
# several are combined there is one camera for all of them, and
# `plottingConvention.default3D` is the oblique view this chapter uses. The three planes
# meet at the centre of the specimen, so a grain crossed by two of them appears in both.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Colour a slice
#
# A slice carries the orientations, phases and properties of the voxels it passes through,
# so it is coloured by exactly the same commands as an imported map. Orientation colouring
# needs a single phase at a time, which for a multi-phase section means one call per phase.

# %% [markdown]
# Each phase is coloured by its own inverse pole figure key, so colours are comparable
# within a phase but not between phases.

# ## Separate orientation from measurement quality
#
# A dark or abruptly changing orientation colour does not by itself indicate a poor
# measurement. Compare a stored quality field with orientation on the same plane.
# `Completeness` is supplied by this Xnovo file; other importers may provide different
# quality measures.

# %% [markdown]
# The IPF reference is a specimen direction. It stays along $z$ even when the cutting
# plane or camera changes. Reuse the same key when comparing orientations on several
# sections. Interpret completeness using the acquisition method; this simulated example
# does not establish a cutoff for experimental data.

# %% [markdown]
# ## A slice is an ordinary EBSD map
#
# Nothing distinguishes the result of `slice` from an imported map, so the planar
# toolchain applies to it directly. Here the section is segmented into grains and the
# boundaries drawn over the phase map.

# These are grains reconstructed independently in two dimensions. A grain connected
# outside this plane can appear as separate regions here, so this segmentation need not
# match a slice of the three-dimensional grains. This data set also ships the segmentation
# of the full volume as the voxel property `grainId`, which the slice carries along.
#
# Reconstructing grains in the volume as closed polyhedra is described in
# [Three-Dimensional Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3D_py.html).

# ## Technical details
#
# MATLAB's `plot(ebsd)` opens its interactive volume viewer, which a page cannot hold; here
# it draws the three middle slices as a figure with an interactive page. `slice(ebsd,
# plane)` is the method `ebsd.slice(plane)`, since `slice` is a Python builtin, and a
# section is drawn face on in the coordinates of its plane rather than through a plotting
# convention of its own.
