# [Crystal symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalSymmetries_py.html) describes operations that leave a crystal
# lattice unchanged. *Specimen symmetry* describes operations that leave the texture of a
# specimen unchanged. The forming process is often the physical reason for this
# invariance.
#
# Rolling, for example, is commonly modelled by orthorhombic specimen symmetry. A texture
# with this symmetry is unchanged by $180^\circ$ rotations about the rolling direction
# (RD), transverse direction (TD), and normal direction (ND).
#
# This is a model of the texture, not a consequence of the specimen having a rectangular
# shape. A shear texture, a through-thickness gradient, or a misaligned specimen may not
# have that symmetry. Imposing symmetry that is absent averages distinct components
# together and hides real information.
#
# An orientation maps coordinates from the crystal frame into the specimen frame. Specimen
# symmetry therefore acts from the left, while crystal symmetry acts from the right. See
# [Symmetrically Equivalent Orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationSymmetry_py.html).
#
# ## Defining a Specimen Symmetry
#
# A `specimenFrame` is defined by its point group. Only a small number of point groups
# occur in practice. The trivial group is the default when no specimen symmetry is
# specified.

# %%
ss = specimenFrame('1')
ss

# %% [markdown]
# Orthorhombic specimen symmetry is the common choice for rolled material. It may be
# specified by its point group `'mmm'` or by the name `'orthorhombic'`.

# %%
ss = specimenFrame('mmm')
ss

# %% [markdown]
# The full point group `mmm` has eight operations. Its proper subgroup has four rotations:
# the identity and one $180^\circ$ rotation about each specimen axis. Orientations live in
# the rotation group, so these proper operations are the ones that identify equivalent
# orientations.

# %%
numberOfOperations = numSym(ss)
numberOfProperRotations = numProper(ss)
numberOfOperations, numberOfProperRotations

# %% [markdown]
# Note the difference between `'1'` and `'triclinic'`. The first denotes the identity
# alone. The lattice-type name `'triclinic'` selects the point group $\bar 1$, which also
# contains inversion.

# %%
numberInIdentityGroup = numSym(specimenFrame('1'))
numberInTriclinicGroup = numSym(specimenFrame('triclinic'))
numberInIdentityGroup, numberInTriclinicGroup

# ## The Effect on an ODF
#
# An [orientation distribution function](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFAnalysis.html) (ODF) is a density over
# orientations. We begin with one smooth component and trivial specimen symmetry.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame.load('quartz.cif')
odf = unimodalODF(orientation.byEuler(30 * degree, 50 * degree, 10 * degree, cs), halfwidth=15 * degree)

# %% [markdown]
# The `complete` and `upper` flags keep the full upper hemisphere visible. This matters for
# the comparison below, because a plot with nontrivial specimen symmetry otherwise defaults
# to its specimen fundamental sector.

# %%
plotPF(odf, Miller(1, 0, -1, 0, cs), contourf=True, complete=True, upper=True)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The peaks are equivalent crystal poles. Notice that their pattern is not forced to be
# symmetric about both horizontal and vertical specimen axes.
#
# The texture index is the squared [norm](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.norm.html) of the ODF. The first value is
# the baseline before specimen symmetry is imposed.

# %%
textureIndexTrivial = norm(odf) ** 2
textureIndexTrivial

# %% [markdown]
# Assigning orthorhombic specimen symmetry makes the ODF invariant under its proper
# rotations. This changes the represented function rather than merely changing its plot.

# %%
odf.SS = specimenFrame('mmm')

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
plotPF(odf, Miller(1, 0, -1, 0, cs), contourf=True, complete=True, upper=True)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The second pole figure is symmetric about the horizontal and vertical specimen axes. The
# density is shared among the equivalent positions, so the peaks are lower than in the
# first plot.

# %%
textureIndexOrthorhombic = norm(odf) ** 2
textureIndexOrthorhombic

# %% [markdown]
# The second texture index is also smaller. Quantities derived from the ODF therefore
# change when specimen symmetry is imposed.
#
# ## Specimen Symmetry and the Specimen Frame
#
# A [reference frame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/referenceFrame.referenceFrame.html) is the coordinate system in which
# data are expressed. A symmetry is the point group under which those data are invariant.
# The two are attached, but they are not the same concept.
#
# Which physical direction a symmetry axis denotes depends on the specimen frame. The point
# group `'112'` has its twofold rotation about the $z$ axis.

# %%
ss = specimenFrame('112')
ss

# %% [markdown]
# The rolling frame names its axes RD, TD, and ND and supplies their plotting convention.
# Asking it for the same point group therefore declares that the twofold $z$ axis is ND,
# and those names appear in summaries and plots.

# %%
ss = specimenFrame.rolling('112')
ss

# %% [markdown]
# Assigning a frame does not rotate an ODF or correct a mounting error. Use
# [Sample Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DetectionOfSampleSymmetry_py.html) to test and align a measured texture
# before imposing a nontrivial symmetry.
