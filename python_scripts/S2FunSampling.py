# # Sampling a Spherical Function
#
# A spherical density is a nonnegative `S2Fun` whose values describe how mass is
# distributed over directions. Some computations need that density replaced by finitely many
# directions. Examples include simulation input, numerical integration, and a scatter plot of
# likely directions.
#
# MTEX can draw directions independently or optimize their placement. It can also attach a
# volume fraction to every optimized direction. This page compares those three choices and
# tests what each sample preserves.

# ## A density with narrow features
#
# The example is the smiley function. Its underlying features are zero on most of the
# sphere and concentrated in the eyes and mouth. The constant background below makes the
# density strictly positive without hiding those narrow features.

# ## Random sampling
#
# [discreteSample](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2Fun.discreteSample.html) draws independent directions with probability
# proportional to the function value. It is fast and unbiased, but a finite random sample
# contains clusters and empty patches.

# %%
vRnd = discreteSample(sF, 1000)

contourf(sF)
hold(True)
scatter(vRnd, markerSize=4, markerFaceColor='k', markerEdgeColor='k')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Notice the uneven gaps between points along the mouth. Those gaps are sampling noise
# rather than low-density parts of the original function.
#
# ## Optimizing the directions
#
# [optimalSample](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2Fun.optimalSample.html) moves the directions until their discrete
# measure is close to the density. This optimization costs more time than independent
# sampling. In return, the directions spread evenly along every feature and become denser
# where the function is large.

# %%
vOpt = optimalSample(sF, 1000, bandwidth=128)

contourf(sF)
hold(True)
scatter(vOpt, markerSize=4, markerFaceColor='k', markerEdgeColor='k')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The optimized sample follows both eyes and the mouth without the random clusters seen
# above. Because this example has a positive background, a few directions also remain away
# from those features.
#
# The `bandwidth` sets the largest harmonic degree that the sample must reproduce. Choose it
# for the intended use of the points. A lower bandwidth asks the optimizer to preserve less
# detail and is faster.
#
# ## Optimizing directions and weights
#
# The points do not have to carry equal mass. Asking `optimalSample` for the weights,
# `optimizeWeights=True`, optimizes them together with the directions. For $M$ directions,
# this gives the discrete measure $M$ additional variables.

# %%
vWgt, c = optimalSample(sF, 100, bandwidth=32, optimizeWeights=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The weights are volume fractions. They are nonnegative and sum to one. The output below
# checks both properties for this sample.

# %%
np.array([np.min(c), np.max(c), np.sum(c)])

# %% [markdown]
# Marker area now follows the weight. A large marker represents a direction that carries a
# larger share of the density.

# %%
contourf(sF)
hold(True)
scatter(vWgt, markerSize=40 * c / np.mean(c), markerFaceColor='k', markerEdgeColor='k')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Notice that the directions remain well distributed, but their shares are no longer equal.
# Directions with almost no mass can be discarded during the optimization by passing the
# `minWeight` option.
#
# We use 100 points and bandwidth 32 so that the weights have visible work to do. With 500
# points and bandwidth 128, the optimized directions already describe this density so well
# that the weights in a measured run ranged only from 0.0019605 to 0.0019609.
#
# ## Comparing the recovered densities
#
# To compare equal point counts, we estimate a density from every sample with
# [calcDensity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.calcDensity.html). The weighted sample passes its volume fractions
# to the estimator. All three estimates use the same kernel halfwidth, so their smoothing is
# identical.
#
# A second error compares the spherical harmonic coefficients of the discrete measure
# directly through degree 32. No smoothing kernel enters this test. This is the coefficient
# discrepancy that `optimalSample` actually minimizes, although its restricted-distance
# objective assigns a degree-dependent weight to each coefficient. The unweighted relative
# norm below is easier to interpret when the sample will be used for integration.

# At every equal point count, an optimized sample recovers the density more accurately than
# the random sample. Two hundred optimized points have an error of 0.44, less than the
# about 0.5 of 800 random points. At 100 points the weighted optimization reduces the error
# from about 0.66 to about 0.53.
#
# The optimized curves flatten near 0.24, while the random curve is still descending. Their
# flattening shows that the 5 degree kernel is becoming a limiting source of error for this
# sharp function.

# Without the smoothing kernel there is no common floor. The optimized samples converge
# more quickly, while random sampling has the familiar $1/\sqrt{M}$ statistical rate. At 50
# points, changing the weights gives essentially no benefit because the directions use most
# of what this small sample can express.
#
# At 800 points, the weighted sample has a coefficient error of 0.09. This is about seven
# times more accurate than the random sample and twice as accurate as the unweighted
# optimized sample.
#
# ## Choosing a sampling method
#
# Use [discreteSample](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2Fun.discreteSample.html) when you need many points quickly and
# their individual placement does not matter. Use [optimalSample](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2Fun.optimalSample.html)
# when the number of points is limited. Ask for weights when the sample will be used for
# integration. For a kernel density estimate, optimized weights usually help less once the
# smoothing halfwidth becomes the main source of error.
#
# ## The maths behind the optimized sample
#
# Directions $\mathbf{v}_j$ and volume fractions $c_j$ represent the density $f$ by the
# discrete measure
#
# $$ \mu = \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{M} c_j\,\delta_{\mathbf{v}_j},
# \qquad \lambda = \int_{S^2} f(\mathbf{v})\,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}. $$
#
# Here $\delta_{\mathbf{v}_j}$ places mass at one direction. The weights satisfy
# $c_j\geq 0$ and $\sum_j c_j=1$. The optimizer moves the directions and, when requested,
# the weights to reduce harmonic discrepancies through the chosen bandwidth.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB's second output `[v, c] = optimalSample(...)` is `optimizeWeights=True` here.
# `norm` is that of the normalised measure, $1/\sqrt{4\pi}$ times MATLAB's, so the density
# errors are $1/\sqrt{4\pi}$ of MATLAB's (0.44 for MATLAB's 1.51, 0.66 and 0.53 for its
# 2.28 and 1.82); the coefficient errors are ratios and compare directly, 0.092, 0.181 and
# 0.622 at 800 points for MATLAB's 0.101, 0.185 and 0.617. The random columns differ from
# run to run. MATLAB's page also compares its table with the numbers of an earlier run,
# which this page leaves out.
