# # Euler Angle Sections
#
# An orientation distribution function (ODF) is defined on the three-dimensional space of
# orientations. A section plot makes this space readable on a page by evaluating the ODF
# on several two-dimensional slices and placing the slices side by side. A section is not
# a projection: it does not integrate density from neighbouring orientations.
#
# This page assumes the ODF normalization introduced in [ODF Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html).
# [Plotting an ODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFPlot_py.html) compares sections with three-dimensional plots, pole
# figures, and inverse pole figures. The Bunge and Matthies angle conventions are
# introduced in [Rotation Representations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationRepresentations_py.html).
#
# The plotting convention below draws specimen Y upward and X to the right. It changes
# only the screen layout, not the ODF or its reference frame.

# ## A Model with Known Features
#
# The example combines the brass and copper components with the beta fibre. The
# coefficients 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 are mixture fractions of normalized components. They are
# not the peak heights seen in a section.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame.load('Al-Aluminum.cif')

ori1 = orientation.brass(cs)
ori2 = orientation.copper(cs)
f = fibre.beta(cs)

odf = 0.2 * unimodalODF(ori1) + 0.3 * unimodalODF(ori2) + 0.5 * fibreODF(f)

# ## Default Bunge Sections
#
# [plotSection](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.plotSection.html) uses sections at constant third Bunge angle
# $\varphi_2$ by default. Here the explicit `'phi2'` flag makes that choice visible. The
# option `sections` sets the number of panels; it does not set the angular resolution
# within a panel.

# %%
plotSection(odf, 'phi2', sections=9, verbose=False, layout=[5, 2], figSize='large')

annotate(ori1, markerSize=15)
annotate(ori2, marker='v', markerSize=15)
plot(f, lineWidth=2, add2all=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The square and triangle locate the brass and copper component centres. The line follows
# the beta fibre. A localized component is confined to nearby panels, whereas the fibre
# continues across a sequence of panels. The nine panels sample the available
# $\varphi_2$ period without repeating its equivalent endpoint.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Choosing the Section Angles
#
# Pass explicit angle values with an option named after the fixed coordinate. The
# following four panels restrict the display to $\varphi_2=25^\circ$, $30^\circ$,
# $35^\circ$, and $40^\circ$. Constructing [phi2Sections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/phi2Sections.html) explicitly
# records this geometry so it can be reused for several ODFs or orientation sets.

# %%
sectionAngles = np.array([25, 30, 35, 40]) * degree
oS = phi2Sections(odf.CS, odf.SS, phi2=sectionAngles)

plotSection(odf, oS, verbose=False, figSize='large', layout=[2, 2])
annotate(ori1, markerSize=15)
annotate(ori2, marker='v', markerSize=15)
plot(f, lineWidth=2, add2all=True)

# %% [markdown]
# This restricted gallery resolves how the beta fibre passes through a narrow interval
# instead of spending space on the full period. Explicit values select slices; they do
# not average the ODF between those values.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Choosing a Section Family
#
# MTEX can hold any Bunge or Matthies Euler coordinate constant. Each family uses its own
# option name for explicit section values.
#
# | flag | fixed coordinate | explicit values |
# |---|---|---|
# | `'phi2'` | third Bunge angle $\varphi_2$ | `phi2=values` |
# | `'phi1'` | first Bunge angle $\varphi_1$ | `phi1=values` |
# | `'Phi'` | second Bunge angle $\Phi$ | `Phi=values` |
# | `'gamma'` | Matthies angle $\gamma$ | `gamma=values` |
# | `'alpha'` | Matthies angle $\alpha$ | `alpha=values` |
# | `'sigma'` | Matthies coordinate $\sigma=\alpha+\gamma$ | `sigma=values` |
#
# The corresponding classes are [phi2Sections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/phi2Sections.html),
# [phi1Sections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/phi1Sections.html), [PhiSections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PhiSections.html),
# [gammaSections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/gammaSections.html), [alphaSections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/alphaSections.html), and
# [sigmaSections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/sigmaSections.html). They share layout, resolution, and the
# [plot-type](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PlotTypes_py.html) options. The `secResolution` option is specific to
# `phi2Sections` and sets the spacing between its section angles.

# ## Sigma Sections
#
# Sigma sections are special. For the usual choice of reference axes, a position within a
# $\sigma$ section is the specimen direction of the crystal axis $\vec c^*$. The section
# angle describes the remaining rotation about that direction. A panel can therefore be
# read much like a pole figure with one extra angular coordinate.
#
# MTEX defines the Matthies coordinate as $\sigma=\alpha+\gamma$. Do not replace it by an
# informal expression in the Bunge angles; the coordinate conventions and reference fields
# matter.

# %%
plotSection(odf, 'sigma', verbose=False, figSize='large')

# %% [markdown]
# The same brass, copper, and fibre contributions are now arranged by the specimen
# direction of the crystal axis $\vec c^*$ and by rotation about it. No density has been
# added or removed; only the coordinates of the slices have changed.
# [Sigma Sections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SigmaSections_py.html) develops this geometric reading for crystals with
# a distinguished axis.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Other Euler Coordinates
#
# Sections at constant first Bunge angle $\varphi_1$ put $\varphi_2$ and $\Phi$ within
# each panel.

# %%
plotSection(odf, 'phi1', sections=6, layout=[3, 2], verbose=False, figSize='large')

# %% [markdown]
# Features that were split mainly along $\varphi_1$ in the default view now remain within
# one panel, while features extended along $\varphi_1$ pass through several panels. This
# is the same ODF sampled on a different family of slices.

# %% [markdown]
# Sections at constant $\gamma$ make the analogous choice in the Matthies convention.

# %%
plotSection(odf, 'gamma', sections=6, layout=[3, 2], verbose=False, figSize='large')

# %% [markdown]
# The panels again redistribute the same features. A useful family is the one that keeps
# the feature of interest compact and makes its relevant specimen or crystal direction
# easy to read. It is not a different ODF.

# ## Euler Plotting Bounds and Crystal Symmetry
#
# Bunge sections use the coordinates $\varphi_1$, $\Phi$, and $\varphi_2$. With identity
# specimen symmetry, MTEX uses the following crystal-symmetry-dependent rectangular
# plotting bounds.
#
# | symmetry | 1 | 2 | 222 | 3 | 32 | 4 | 422 | 6 | 622 | 23 | 432 |
# |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
# | $\varphi_1$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ |
# | $\Phi$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ |
# | $\varphi_2$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $120^{\circ}$ | $120^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ | $60^{\circ}$ | $60^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ |
#
# Crystal symmetry does not restrict the first Euler angle. With identity specimen
# symmetry, $\varphi_1$ therefore spans $0^\circ$ through $360^\circ$ for every crystal
# symmetry in the table. For point groups 23 and 432, this rectangular box does not
# account for the threefold axis. Each orientation consequently appears three times
# within the box.
#
# [fundamentalRegionEuler](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/referenceFrame.fundamentalRegionEuler.html) returns these
# upper bounds for an arbitrary pair of crystal and specimen symmetries. They describe a
# plotting box, not necessarily a compact fundamental region with exactly one
# representative. The latter is introduced in
# [Fundamental Regions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFundamentalRegion_py.html).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Specimen Symmetry
#
# Specimen symmetry can restrict the first Euler angle. Orthotropic specimen symmetry
# reduces it to $90^\circ$ for this cubic example and produces the common square-shaped
# ODF panels. Assigning a specimen symmetry changes the symmetry used to represent the
# function; it does not rotate the texture or change its specimen reference frame. See
# [Specimen Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SpecimenSymmetry_py.html) before applying such a symmetry to measured
# data. A classical gallery at $5^\circ$ intervals can be requested with `sections=18`.
# Six panels are sufficient here to show the changed bounds while keeping this executable
# page practical.

# %%
odfOrtho = odf
odfOrtho.SS = specimenFrame('222')

# %%
plotSection(odfOrtho, 'phi2', sections=6, layout=[3, 2], coordinates='off', xlabel='', ylabel='', verbose=False, figSize='large')

# %% [markdown]
# The displayed bounds are $90^\circ$ by $90^\circ$ by $90^\circ$. Accordingly, every
# panel is square, whereas the panels above spanned $360^\circ$ in $\varphi_1$. Specimen
# symmetry has restricted $\varphi_1$ only; the $\varphi_2$ period is unchanged, so the
# six panels still sample it from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$.
