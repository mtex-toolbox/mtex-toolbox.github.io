# # Vector-valued spherical functions
#
# A vector-valued spherical function collects several scalar functions on the sphere in one
# array,
#
# $$ f\colon \mathrm{S}^2\to\mathbb{R}^n. $$
#
# Its output components are numerical values. This differs from a
# [spherical vector field](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunVectorField_py.html), whose output is a geometric vector, and
# from a [spherical axis field](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunAxisField_py.html), whose output is unchanged when its
# representative is reversed. Use a vector-valued `S2Fun` when the components should support
# array indexing, concatenation and reduction. Component shape is independent of
# point-group invariance. Use [symmetric spherical functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunSym_py.html) when all
# components share one symmetry.

# ## How component arrays are laid out
#
# MTEX interprets the evaluation nodes as the leading dimensions of the returned values. The
# dimensions of the spherical-function array follow them.
#
# For example, suppose four nodes $v_1,\ldots,v_4$ are evaluated by six scalar functions
# stored as a $3\times2$ spherical-function array. The returned array `F` has shape
# $(4, 3, 2)$, with
#
# $$ F[i, :, 0]=[f_1(v_i),f_2(v_i),f_3(v_i)] $$
#
# and
#
# $$ F[i, :, 1]=[f_4(v_i),f_5(v_i),f_6(v_i)]. $$

fourNodes = vector3d.cat(xvector, yvector, zvector, vector3d.byPolar(60 * degree, 45 * degree))
sixValueFunction = lambda v: np.reshape(np.stack([v.x, v.y, v.z, v.x ** 2, v.y ** 2, v.z ** 2], axis=-1),
                                        (v.size, 3, 2), order='F')
F = sixValueFunction(fourNodes)
valueArraySize = F.shape
valueArraySize

# %% [markdown]
# Accordingly, `valueArraySize` is `(4, 3, 2)`. Index `F[i, j, k]` is the value at node `i`
# of component `(j, k)`. This rule lets one evaluation retain both the node layout and the
# component-array layout.
#
# ## Interpolate sampled component values
#
# The same convention applies when fitting a harmonic representation. Here the two columns
# of `sampleValues` define two scalar functions at every node.

# %%
nodes = equispacedS2Grid(points=800)
nodes = nodes.flatten()
sampleValues = np.stack([S2Fun.smiley(nodes), nodes.x * nodes.y], axis=-1)

# %% [markdown]
# [interpolate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunHarmonic.interpolate.html) takes the component dimensions after the node
# dimension. The resulting `sF1` has shape `(2,)`.

# %%
sF1 = S2FunHarmonic.interpolate(nodes, sampleValues, bandwidth=12, weights='equal')
componentArraySize = sF1.shape

# ## Plot the components
#
# The scalar plotting commands also accept a vector-valued function. MTEX draws one panel per
# component rather than combining their values.

# %%
plot(sF1, upper=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The first panel contains the smiley. The second has four lobes because the sign of $xy$
# alternates between neighboring quadrants. Separate panels are essential here: the two
# values are components, not the coordinates of arrows.
#
# ## Construct from a function
#
# A function must return one row per input direction and one column per component. This
# example retains the original peaked scalar component and appends the Cartesian coordinate
# functions $x$, $y$ and $z$.

# %%
fourComponentFunction = lambda v: np.stack([np.exp(v.x + v.y + v.z) + 50 * (v.y - np.cos(np.pi / 3)) ** 3 * (v.y - np.cos(np.pi / 3) > 0),
                                            v.x, v.y, v.z], axis=-1)

# %% [markdown]
# Passing the function to the constructor applies quadrature. The harmonic cutoff is degree
# 50, and the resulting `sF2` has shape `(4,)`.

# %%
sF2 = S2FunHarmonic(fourComponentFunction, bandwidth=50)

# ## Construct from harmonic coefficients
#
# If the coefficients are already known, pass them directly to the
# [S2FunHarmonic](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunHarmonic.S2FunHarmonic.html) constructor. The last dimension of
# `fhat` holds the coefficients of one scalar function. Component-array dimensions come
# before it.
#
# Thus, if $\widehat f_1,\ldots,\widehat f_6$ are coefficient rows for the $3\times2$
# example above, their arrangement is
#
# $$ \widehat F[:, 0, :]=[\widehat f_1,\widehat f_2,\widehat f_3] $$
#
# and
#
# $$ \widehat F[:, 1, :]=[\widehat f_4,\widehat f_5,\widehat f_6]. $$

# %%
sF3 = S2FunHarmonic(np.eye(9))

# %% [markdown]
# Each row of the identity selects one coefficient. Consequently, `sF3` stores the first
# nine spherical harmonics as nine component functions. Most applications construct
# functions from values and never need to access this coefficient layout directly.
#
# ## Index, concatenate and reshape components
#
# Component arrays follow ordinary array indexing. Concatenation combines the two functions
# in `sF1` with the four in `sF2`, while indexing selects components.

# %%
sF4 = S2FunHarmonic.cat(sF1, sF2)
selectedFunctions = sF4[1:3]

# %% [markdown]
# Conjugation acts on the coefficients. Transpose and conjugate transpose rearrange the
# component dimensions.

# %%
conjugatedFunctions = conj(sF1)
transposedFunctions = sF1.T
conjugateTransposedFunctions = conj(sF1).T

# %% [markdown]
# `len` and `shape` inspect the component array rather than the coefficient dimension.
# Reshaping the nine functions in `sF3` produces a $3\times3$ spherical-function array.

# %%
numberOfFunctions = len(sF1)
shapeOfHandleFunctions = sF2.shape
sF3 = sF3.reshape(3, -1)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Integrate or reduce components
#
# With no axis argument, `sum` integrates every component over the sphere and `mean` returns
# the spherical mean of every component. Their outputs are numerical arrays with the shape
# of `sF`.

# %%
componentIntegrals = sum(sF1)
componentMeans = mean(sF1)

# %% [markdown]
# With an axis argument, the same commands perform pointwise array reductions and return
# another spherical function.

# %%
rowSums = sum(sF3, axis=1)
columnMeans = mean(sF3, axis=0)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Pointwise minima and maxima
#
# For a vector-valued function, pass the component axis. The result is the pointwise minimum
# or maximum along that component axis.

# %%
columnMinima = min(sF3, axis=0)

# ## A note on products
#
# A product between two `S2FunHarmonic` arrays acts pointwise, one function with the
# function at the same position.

# ## Technical Details
#
# The component axes follow NumPy: indices start at zero, `reshape` fills rows first, where
# MATLAB fills columns, and an axis is named by `axis=` counted from zero, MATLAB's
# `sum(sF3, 2)` being `sum(sF3, axis=1)`. The coefficients sit on the last axis of `fhat`,
# where MATLAB has them on the first; a list of $n$ functions has the shape `(n,)`, where
# MATLAB's is $n\times 1$. MATLAB's `min(sF3, [], 1)` is `min(sF3, axis=0)`, its `'` is
# `conj(sF).T`.
