# # Using fibres to evaluate grain dispersion axes
#
# A grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected part of an EBSD map. It contains
# many measured orientations rather than one exact orientation. When those orientations
# follow one dominant rotation, they trace a fibre in orientation space. The axis of that
# fibre is the grain's dispersion axis.
#
# This page develops the construction for one grain and then repeats it over a map. Read
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) and
# [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html) first if grains and grain ids are new to you.
# [Orientation Parameters](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainOrientationParameters_py.html) introduces the grain mean,
# GROD, and grain orientation spread.
#
# A dispersion axis is an axis, not a directed vector. Its two ends are equivalent. Its
# crystal-frame representation can constrain a deformation mechanism, while its
# specimen-frame representation can constrain the kinematics. Neither interpretation
# follows from the fit alone.

# ## Find a grain with coherent intragranular rotation

# First colour each forsterite measurement by its misorientation from the mean orientation
# of its own grain. The hue gives the misorientation axis in the specimen frame, and the
# saturation gives the angle. The reference orientation is supplied per measurement
# through `ck.oriRef`.

#
# Orientations produced by one continuous rotation lie on an

# orientations inside one grain.

# interpretation depends on a correctly calibrated frame.

# ## Decide whether the grain really has one axis
#
# A best fit always exists, even for a round cloud with no meaningful axis. The two
# additional outputs from `fibre.fit` diagnose that case. `lam` contains the four
# eigenvalues of the quaternion orientation tensor in ascending order. `fitAngle` is the
# mean angular distance from the fitted fibre.

# The largest eigenvalue, $\lambda_4$, records overall concentration. The next,

# from it. Their ratio is a useful screening statistic for this example.

# Here the printed ratio is well above one, so the cloud is more line-like than round. The
# cutoff of three used below is a heuristic for this page, not a universal MTEX threshold.
# A defensible cutoff also depends on EBSD angular precision, grain size, cleaning, and
# the deformation expected.

# Small-angle rotation axes are especially sensitive to EBSD error. Do not interpret a
# stable-looking axis from a nearly uniform grain without first checking the angle scale

# This maximum is stronger and lies near [010], with density falling towards [100]. The
# forsterite grains therefore bend about their own [010] direction more often than about
# other crystal directions in this map. A rotation axis can narrow the candidate slip
# mechanisms, but it does not identify a unique slip system without boundary geometry or
# dislocation evidence.
#
# Keep the two frames separate. A specimen-frame cluster supports a shared kinematic
# frame, while a crystal-frame cluster supports a shared crystallographic mechanism. This
# data set shows both preferences, with the crystal-frame preference the stronger of the
# two.

# ## Technical details
#
# `ori * s2G` over a list of orientations and a list of directions is the outer product
# `ori.reshape(-1, 1) * s2G.reshape(1, -1)`, and the mean of the directions of every cloud
# is `mean(directions, axis=0)`. The eigenvalues come as `lam[0]` to `lam[3]`, so MATLAB's
# `lambda(3)/lambda(2)` is `lam[2] / lam[1]`. The measurements the closing absorbed carry
# no orientation, so the statistics skip them with NumPy's `nan` forms.
