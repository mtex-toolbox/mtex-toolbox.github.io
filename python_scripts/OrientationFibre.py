# # Fibres of Orientations
#
# A *fibre* is a one-dimensional curve through orientation space. Every orientation on a
# full fibre maps one fixed crystal direction `h` onto one fixed specimen direction `r`
# while leaving rotation about that direction free. MTEX stores the curve as a
# [fibre](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/fibre.fibre.html) variable.
#
# Many real textures concentrate around a line rather than one ideal orientation. Rolling
# textures of cubic metals are therefore commonly described by named fibres. A real
# texture has a finite spread around the curve; the curve itself is the ideal centreline.
#
# This page assumes [orientation construction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationDefinition_py.html),
# [symmetry-equivalent orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationSymmetry_py.html), and
# [the fundamental region](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFundamentalRegion_py.html). The Cube and Goss components
# below are introduced in [Standard Orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationStandard_py.html).
#
# A *reference frame* is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. The plotting
# convention below lays specimen Y upward and specimen X to the right. It changes only the
# screen layout, not the orientations.

# %%

cs = crystalFrame('432')
ss = specimenFrame('1')

# define two ideal orientations
ori1 = orientation.cube(cs, ss)
ori2 = orientation.goss(cs, ss)

# select the representative of Goss nearest to Cube
ori2 = ori2.projectIntoFundamentalRegion(ori1)

# %% [markdown]
# ## A Fibre Segment Between Two Orientations
#
# The endpoint constructor joins two orientation representatives by their shortest angular
# path. The result is a finite segment, not yet the full closed fibre.

# %%
segmentFibre = fibre(ori1, ori2)

# %% [markdown]
# The summary identifies the aligned directions in its `h` and `r` row. Its endpoint row
# runs from Cube at $(0^\circ,0^\circ,0^\circ)$ to Goss at $(0^\circ,45^\circ,0^\circ)$ in
# Bunge Euler angles. Both endpoints, and every orientation `ori` between them, satisfy
#
# $$ \mathtt{ori} * h = r. $$
#
# The two directions belong to different reference frames: `h` is in the crystal frame and
# `r` is in the specimen frame.
#
# ## The Segment in Euler Space
#
# The default three-dimensional orientation plot uses Bunge Euler coordinates.

# %% [markdown]
# The green line runs from the dark-red Cube marker to the blue Goss marker. It looks
# straight because only $\Phi$ changes for this pair. In general, a shortest angular path
# need not look straight in Euler coordinates.
#
# ## The Same Segment in Axis--Angle Space

# %%
plot(segmentFibre, 'axisAngle', lineColor='green', lineWidth=6)
hold(True)
plot(ori1, 'axisAngle', markerFaceColor='darkred', markerSize=15)
plot(ori2, 'axisAngle', markerFaceColor='blue', markerSize=15)

# This is the same orientation-space segment in different coordinates. The endpoints and
# angular distances have not changed. Only the coordinate map used to draw them has
# changed.
#
# ## Extending the Segment to a Full Fibre
#
# The option `full` discards the finite endpoint and continues through every rotation
# about the aligned direction.

# %%
fullFibre = fibre(ori1, ori2, full=True)
fullFibre

# %% [markdown]
# The `h` and `r` row is unchanged, while the endpoint row has disappeared. Orientation
# space itself has no boundary, so the full fibre closes into a circle. Coordinate domains
# and symmetry-reduced fundamental regions do have seams and boundaries, however, and can
# cut that circle into arcs.

# %%
hold(True)
plot(fullFibre, 'axisAngle', lineColor='gold', lineWidth=3, fundamentalRegion=True)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The gold curve continues the green segment to the faces of the cubic fundamental region.
# Its boundary points reconnect through symmetry-equivalent faces, so this
# boundary-to-boundary line represents one closed fibre.
#
# ## Fibres in Pole Figures
#
# Everything that can be plotted for orientations can also be plotted for fibres.
# [plotPF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/fibre.plotPDF.html) maps the fibre into [pole figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationPoleFigure_py.html),
# where one orientation becomes a point and a fibre becomes a curve.

# %%
h = Miller([[1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]], cs)
plotPF(fullFibre, h, lineWidth=3, lineColor='orange')

# %% [markdown]
# Each panel contains one trace from the representative fibre. A trace may meet a
# projection boundary, but it still represents one continuous set of orientations.
#
# ## Symmetrising a Fibre
#
# Unlike an orientation pole-figure plot, a fibre is not automatically symmetrised.
# [symmetrise](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/fibre.symmetrise.html) generates the crystallographically equivalent
# fibres. The `unique` option removes repeated copies.

# %%
symFibre = fullFibre.symmetrise(unique=True)
symmetryCopyCount = len(symFibre)
symmetryCopyCount

# %% [markdown]
# The six copies correspond to the six cubic equivalents of the aligned crystal direction.
# Plotting them adds the orange traces that were absent from the representative-only pole
# figures.

# %%
plotPF(symFibre, Miller([[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]], cs), lineWidth=3, lineColor='orange')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Fibres in Inverse Pole Figures
#
# [plotIPF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/fibre.plotIPDF.html) maps the fibre into
# [inverse pole figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationInversePoleFigure_py.html). It fixes specimen directions
# and draws the crystal directions found along the fibre. By default it restricts them to
# the fundamental sector.

# %%
r = vector3d([[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]])
plotIPF(symFibre, r, lineWidth=3, lineColor='orange')

# %% [markdown]
# Each panel folds the symmetry copies into one fundamental sector. The orange curve is
# therefore the family of crystal directions that can lie along the specimen direction
# named above that panel.
#
# ## The Complete Inverse Pole Figure
#
# The option `complete` removes the fundamental-sector restriction.

# %%
plotIPF(symFibre, vector3d.Z, complete=True, lineWidth=3, lineColor='orange')

# %% [markdown]
# The complete plot repeats the curve across the full crystal-direction sphere. Those
# repeated traces are symmetry equivalents, not additional input fibres.
#
# ## Defining a Fibre by Directions
#
# A [Miller](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Miller.html) direction and a [vector3d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.vector3d.html) specimen
# direction define the full fibre directly. The next fibre contains every orientation that
# makes the crystal c-axis $[001]$ parallel to specimen Z.

# %%
cAxisFibre = fibre(Miller(0, 0, 1, cs, 'uvw'), vector3d.Z)
cAxisFibre

# %% [markdown]
# The summary states that [001] is parallel to (0,0,1). The directions are shown in crystal
# and specimen coordinates, respectively.

# %%
plot(cAxisFibre, 'axisAngle', lineColor='gold', lineWidth=4, fundamentalRegion=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The gold line is the symmetry-reduced image of every possible rotation about the aligned
# c-axis. Its two boundary ends continue into one another, so it represents one full fibre
# rather than one finite segment.
#
# If both constructor directions are `Miller` variables, the fibre instead contains all
# misorientations that bring one crystal direction into alignment with the other.
#
# ## A Fibre Through One Orientation
#
# An initial orientation `ori1` and a crystal direction `h` define all orientations that
# preserve the mapped direction of `ori1`:
#
# $$ \mathtt{ori} * h = \mathtt{ori1} * h. $$
#
# The following full fibre passes through Cube and rotates about its $[111]$ axis.

# %%
cube111Fibre = fibre(ori1, Miller(1, 1, 1, cs, 'uvw'))
cube111Fibre

# %% [markdown]
# Its summary reports that [111] is parallel to (1,1,1). Cube maps this crystal direction
# onto the same specimen direction.

# %%
plot(cube111Fibre, 'axisAngle', lineColor='darkred', lineWidth=4, fundamentalRegion=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The dark-red curve passes through the Cube orientation at zero angle. Its ends meet the
# boundary at symmetry-equivalent continuations of the curve.
#
# [orientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/fibre.orientation.html) samples a fibre for numerical work.
# [angle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/fibre.angle.html) measures the angular distance from an orientation to its
# nearest point on a fibre. Their geometric use without crystal symmetry is developed in
# [Fibres in Rotation Space](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationFibre_py.html).
#
# ## Predefined Rolling Fibres
#
# Cubic rolling textures have named segments, as their ideal components do: alpha, beta,
# gamma, epsilon, eta, tau, and theta. MTEX provides each as a static `fibre` constructor.
# These names assume the conventional rolling frame and orthorhombic specimen symmetry.

# %%
ss = specimenFrame('orthorhombic')
beta = fibre.beta(cs, ss)

# %% [markdown]
# Plot the conventional endpoint segment returned by each constructor. Passing
# `full=True` would extend that segment around its entire direction-pair circle.

# %%
plot(fibre.alpha(cs, ss), lineWidth=3, lineColor=ind2color(1), displayName='alpha')
hold(True)
plot(fibre.beta(cs, ss), lineWidth=3, lineColor=ind2color(2), displayName='beta')
plot(fibre.gamma(cs, ss), lineWidth=3, lineColor=ind2color(3), displayName='gamma')

legend(location='best')

# %% [markdown]
# The coloured curves occupy different routes through Euler space and meet at some shared
# ideal components. Each colour marks only the conventional named segment, not every point
# on its full direction-pair circle.
#
# ## Fibre ODFs
#
# A fibre is a curve of zero orientation-space volume, while a real texture has a spread
# around one. [fibreODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/fibreODF.html) turns the full curve into a density with a given
# halfwidth. This is the model fitted against a measurement.

# %%
betaFull = fibre.beta(cs, ss, full=True)
odf = fibreODF(betaFull, halfwidth=10 * degree)

# %% [markdown]
# The result is an `SO3FunCBF` with a de la Vallée Poussin kernel. Its $10^\circ$
# halfwidth is the distance where the density has fallen to half its peak, not a cutoff
# radius. The density is constant along the ideal fibre and decays away from it.

# %%
plot3d(odf)
hold(True)
plot(betaFull.symmetrise(), lineColor='blue', lineWidth=4)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The blue curves are the ideal centrelines. The surrounding surface is the finite-width
# density, so it forms a tube rather than a line.
#
# ## Evaluating an ODF Along a Fibre
#
# [plotFibre](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.plotFibre.html) evaluates an ODF along a chosen curve. Here the
# beta-fibre ODF is read along the eta fibre.

# %%
plotFibre(odf, fibre.eta(cs, ss), lineWidth=2, figSize='small')

# %% [markdown]
# The vertical axis is density in multiples of a random distribution. The broad maximum
# marks the part of the eta segment closest to the beta-fibre ridge.
#
# ## The Volume Around a Fibre
#
# [volume](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.volume.html) integrates the ODF inside a tube of a given angular radius
# about a fibre. This is the quantity meant when a texture is reported as "so many percent
# beta fibre".

# %%
volume5Percent = 100 * volume(odf, betaFull, 5 * degree)
volume5Percent

# %% [markdown]
# The result is about 58 percent within $5^\circ$ of the fibre it was built on. At the
# $10^\circ$ kernel halfwidth, the numerical tube integral reaches unity.

# %%
volume10Percent = 100 * volume(odf, betaFull, 10 * degree)
volume10Percent

# %% [markdown]
# The second result is 100 percent to the precision printed. It does not mean the ODF is a
# zero-width line or vanishes at $10^\circ$. [fibreVolume](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.fibreVolume.html)
# discretises the tube and clips its numerical estimate at 1, so the displayed percentage
# can be exactly 100.
#
# ## The Maths Behind Pole Figures
#
# Let $f(g)$ be an ODF, $h$ a crystal direction, and $r$ a specimen direction. The pole
# density at $r$ is
#
# $$ P_h(r) = \int_{\{g:\,g h=r\}} f(g)\,\mathrm{d}g. $$
#
# The integration set is exactly the full orientation fibre defined by `g * h = r`. This
# crystallographic Radon transform connects the geometry on this page to measured pole
# figures and ODF reconstruction; see the [pole figure tutorial](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureTutorial_py.html).
