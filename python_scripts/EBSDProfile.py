# # Line Profiles
#
# A map shows an orientation gradient as a change of colour, but colour is difficult to
# read quantitatively. A line profile turns the same change into a curve against
# distance. A steady lattice rotation then appears as a slope, whereas an abrupt change
# appears as a jump.
#
# This page assumes the grain segmentation introduced in
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) and the inverse pole figures
# introduced in [Orientation Plots](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDOrientationPlots_py.html). Check the specimen
# reference frame as described in [Reference Frame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) before
# interpreting a profile direction.
#
# The example uses the forsterite map. Its plotting convention draws specimen Y upward
# and specimen X to the right.

# ## Select a grain with a large orientation spread
#
# A grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels produced by
# segmentation. Reconstruct the grains with a 15° boundary threshold, then select the
# grain with the largest grain orientation spread (GOS). GOS is the mean angular
# deviation from the grain's mean orientation;
# [Orientation Parameters](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainOrientationParameters_py.html) explains it in detail.

# %%
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, minPixel=5, angle=15 * degree)
id = np.argmax(grains.GOS)
grainSelected = grains[id]
grainSelected

# %%
# plot the selected grain with its measured orientations
plot(grainSelected.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(True)
plot(ebsd[grainSelected], ebsd[grainSelected].orientations, ipfDirection=zvector)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Its spread is 9.7°, which is large for a single grain. The orientation colours change
# visibly from one end to the other, so this grain is a useful place to compare gradual
# rotation with abrupt jumps.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Draw and extract the profile
#
# Specify the segment by its two endpoint coordinates and draw it on the map. In
# interactive work, clicking the two endpoints of the line with matplotlib's `ginput`
# gives the same pair. Fixed coordinates keep this published example executable. They
# use the same units as the map.

# [spatialProfile](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.spatialProfile.html) returns the measurements near the segment
# in traversal order. Its second output is their projected distance from the first
# endpoint. The object summary shows that this profile contains 86 measurements.

# ## Compare point-to-origin and point-to-point changes
#
# The point-to-origin curve compares every orientation with the first one on the line.
# It shows the accumulated change, but its value depends on that chosen reference point.
# The point-to-point curve compares consecutive measurements and exposes local jumps.

oriLine = ebsdLine.orientations
toOrigin = angle(oriLine[0], oriLine) / degree
pointToPoint = angle(oriLine[:-1], oriLine[1:]) / degree
midDist = 0.5 * (profileDist[:-1] + profileDist[1:])

# %% [markdown]
# The point-to-origin curve climbs steadily to about 7° over a little more than half the
# line, then jumps to 20° and stays nearly flat. The point-to-point curve says the same
# thing locally. It remains at a few tenths of a degree almost everywhere, which reveals
# the steady bending, but contains three isolated spikes; the largest is 21°.
#
# The point-to-point values are angular increments, not spatial gradients. Divide them
# by the corresponding distance increments to obtain an angle per unit length. Small
# increments are also sensitive to measurement noise and to the scan step size, so
# compare profiles acquired at a common spatial scale.
#
# A jump of 21° inside one grain deserves attention because the grains were
# reconstructed with a threshold of 15°. It is not a contradiction. Segmentation joins
# neighboring pixels whose disorientation is below the threshold, and the two parts of
# this grain are connected by a path that goes around the jump. The three gaps trace
# pixels that were notIndexed before reconstruction. They were absorbed into the grain
# footprint, but `calcGrains` did not invent orientations for them.

# ## Track the full orientations in inverse pole figures
#
# A misorientation angle discards the axis about which the crystal turns. Plotting the
# orientations in inverse pole figures retains that directional information. Colouring
# the markers by distance retains their order along the line.

# %% [markdown]
# Every panel holds the same two groups. The measurements before the jump, dark blue
# through teal, trace a short chain rather than a point: their directions spread by up
# to 7° in the x and z panels and 4° in y, which is the gradual bending seen in the
# curves above. The measurements after the jump are all yellow and lie within about 1°
# of each other, so they merge into one marker.
#
# How far apart the two groups appear depends on the specimen direction. Their means are
# 17° and 18° apart in the y and z panels, but only 8° apart in x, where the yellow
# marker touches the end of the chain. A jump that is unmistakable in one inverse pole
# figure can be inconspicuous in another, which is why all three are plotted. Inspecting
# both angle and direction helps distinguish a coherent lattice rotation from isolated
# indexing artefacts.
