# # Boundary Plots
#
# A grain boundary is stored as short segments between neighboring EBSD pixels that belong
# to different grains. A value attached to each segment can therefore be drawn as the
# colour of that short line.
#
# The right colour encoding depends on the value. A misorientation angle is one number and
# needs a colorbar. A misorientation axis is a direction and needs a direction key. The
# full misorientation has three parameters and needs a key for rotation space.
#
# This page assumes that the map has already been divided into
# [grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html). See
# [Select Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundarySelect_py.html) for choosing segments and
# [Theory of Misorientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html) for the angle-axis description
# used below.

# The misorientation angle is the smallest rotation angle relating the two crystal
# orientations. It is a useful first separation between low-angle boundaries within
# deformed grains and high-angle boundaries between grains.

# %% [markdown]
# The colour is nearly constant along each boundary and changes between neighboring
# grains. The angles run from 15.9 to 108.8 degrees, with a median of 56.4 degrees.
#
# Nothing below 15 degrees can appear because grain reconstruction used that threshold.
# Every segment in `gB_Fo` is therefore a high-angle boundary by construction.
# [Subgrain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SubGrainBoundaries_py.html) shows how to retain and plot the
# low-angle boundaries inside grains.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The misorientation axis in crystal coordinates
#
# The axis is a direction, so a colorbar would be meaningless. Expressed in crystal
# coordinates, it identifies lattice directions about which the neighboring crystals are
# rotated.
#
# Crystal symmetry gives several equivalent descriptions of the same axis.
# [HSVDirectionKey](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/HSVDirectionKey.html) folds them into one fundamental sector and
# assigns one colour to each direction there.

# preferred crystal directions that are difficult to see from the coloured boundary map
# alone.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The misorientation axis in specimen coordinates
#
# The same axis can be expressed in the specimen reference frame. It then describes how
# the two lattices are related in space rather than which crystal direction is involved.
#
# The misorientation stored on a segment is a crystal-to-crystal rotation, so it no longer
# contains the specimen frame. The two measured orientations on either side are needed,
# and `ebsdId` leads back to them.

# %% [markdown]
# Sampling every fifth segment keeps the arrows readable without changing the boundary
# map. Because segments are stored in walk order, the arrows remain distributed along the
# boundary chains.
#
# Each line is the projection of an axis into the measurement surface. A short line is
# therefore not a small rotation. It is an axis pointing steeply out of the section plane.
#
# Symmetry reduction can also make neighboring segments choose different equivalent axes,
# especially near the largest possible misorientation angle.
# [Misorientations at Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryMisorientations_py.html) explains how to
# recognize that jump.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Colouring the whole misorientation
#
# Angle and axis together are three parameters.
# [axisAngleColorKey](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/axisAngleColorKey.axisAngleColorKey.html) maps all three to a single
# RGB colour: the axis through the direction key of the whole sphere and the angle through
# the saturation.

# %% [markdown]
# The sections confirm the clustering: 300 measured misorientations occupy a few small
# parts of the key instead of filling the available space. A misorientation and its
# inverse are drawn at the same place because they describe the same boundary viewed from
# opposite sides.

# %% [markdown]
# ## What the colours do not describe
#
# The colour contains the full three-parameter misorientation, not the full grain-boundary
# character. Two further parameters specify the boundary-plane orientation. A
# two-dimensional EBSD map measures only the plane trace and cannot recover its
# inclination from one boundary.
#
# The same colour therefore does not by itself imply the same boundary energy, structure
# or chemistry. See [Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainBoundaries.html) for the five-parameter
# description and [Boundary Normal Distribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryNormalDistribution_py.html) for what
# can be inferred from many traces.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB colours a complete misorientation with `PatalaColorKey`, which is not ported; the
# page uses `axisAngleColorKey` instead. Both spend one colour on each misorientation, so
# the reading of the two figures is the same, but the colours themselves differ and the
# Patala key's grain-exchange construction is not reproduced.
#
# `ebsd['id', M]` returns one measurement per entry of the matrix `M`, in its shape, so
# the two columns of `ebsdId` give the two orientation lists. `axis(o1, o2)` is their
# misorientation axis in the specimen frame. `gB_Fo[::5]` is MATLAB's `gB_Fo(1:5:end)`.
