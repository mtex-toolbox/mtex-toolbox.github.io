# # Grain Reconstruction
#
# A *grain* is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels produced by
# segmentation. A phase change between neighbouring pixels is always a grain boundary.
# Within one phase, the usual segmentation rule asks whether the orientations differ by
# more than a chosen angle. The command that applies these rules is `calcGrains`.
#
# This page assumes that you can select and plot an [EBSD map](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDAnalysis.html). If the
# angle between two orientations is new to you, first see
# [Misorientation Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html).
#
# Three settings shape the result. They are the boundary misorientation angle, the
# treatment of measurements that could not be indexed, and the minimum number of pixels
# returned as a grain. They are segmentation choices, not properties measured independently
# from the specimen. We take them one at a time on a map that exercises all three.

# MTEX first partitions the measured surface into one spatial cell per measurement.
# Neighbouring cells are then connected or separated by the segmentation rule, and
# connected cells are collected into grains. On this regular grid, the cell edges lie
# between measurement points. The plotted boundaries therefore follow the grid in steps
# rather than passing through the points.
#
# Although a fifth of the map is notIndexed, only one grain is notIndexed: the long white
# bar right of centre. The other notIndexed pixels have been absorbed by adjacent grains.
# The section on `alpha` below explains this default behaviour.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The threshold angle
#
# The option `angle` sets the misorientation above which two neighbouring measurements of
# the same phase are separated by a boundary. Its default is 15 degrees. Values between 10
# and 15 degrees are long-standing conventions, not measurements; see the discussion in
# [the chapter opener](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains.html).
#
# On a recrystallised map like this one the exact value hardly matters.

# %%

  g = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=threshold)

# %% [markdown]
# Between 5 and 15 degrees the printed count changes by less than one tenth. It rises
# sharply only at 2 degrees. Neighbouring measurements on this map are usually either far
# below all these thresholds or far above them. Few ambiguous pairs lie in between. This is
# a property of the material, not of the algorithm. It stops being true in the deformed
# example later on.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Measurements that were not indexed
#
# A notIndexed measurement is not missing from the map. Its diffraction pattern could not
# be indexed, and MTEX records that fact as the degenerate phase `notIndexed`. Like any
# other phase, a connected notIndexed area can form a grain with a boundary around it.
#
# Whether this is what you want depends on the patch. A wide unindexed region is part of
# the specimen about which you know nothing. It should remain a grain of its own. A
# one-pixel-wide seam along a grain boundary instead records indexing failure where two
# lattices overlap. Leaving such a seam creates a spurious grain between the indexed grains
# on either side.
#
# The option `alpha` controls the spatial closing that distinguishes these cases. Its value
# is a radius in multiples of the pixel spacing. A notIndexed area narrower than about
# `2*alpha` pixel spacings is absorbed by the surrounding grains, while a wider area
# survives. The default is `alpha = 3.1`.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# With `alpha = 0` nothing is absorbed. The notIndexed pixels then contribute more than one
# thousand grains of their own, five times the number of indexed grains found with the
# default. Their seams also divide regions that should be single indexed grains, so the
# indexed count rises from 210 to 525. A closing radius of one pixel removes almost all of
# them. The default keeps only the wide notIndexed region, while `alpha = 6` absorbs that
# one too.
#
# The effect is easiest to see when the two extremes are drawn on the same part of the
# map.

# The isolated orange pixels keep boundaries on both sides because they are indexed
# diopside. The `minPixel` option below deals with such small indexed grains.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Small indexed grains
#
# Even with the unindexed seams absorbed, a threshold criterion produces grains of one, two
# or three pixels where a few measurements are mis-indexed. On this map the isolated
# indexed islands are implausible, but a small grain can be real in another specimen.
# Inspect the map before choosing a cutoff. The option `minPixel` removes an indexed grain
# below the cutoff from the returned list. It marks that grain's measurements notIndexed
# rather than merging them into a neighbour. Since it marks them in the map it was given,
# every step of the sweep below works on a copy of the map.

# grain statistics greatly. It scarcely changes the large-scale microstructure visible in

# %% [markdown]
# ## Smoothing the boundaries
#
# Because the boundaries run between measurement points, they follow the measurement grid
# in steps - the staircase effect. This is a property of the reconstruction, not of the
# material. It biases measurements such as boundary length and direction. The command
# `smoothBoundary` first simplifies the staircase, then resamples the boundary at even
# spacing, and finally applies a smoothing filter. With the default filter, its numeric
# argument is the number of Laplacian smoothing iterations.

# %% [markdown]
# The steps are gone while the larger-scale course of each boundary remains. Smoothing is
# still a measurement choice rather than recovered sub-pixel truth, and the default filter
# can shrink grains. How far to smooth and which filter to use are the subject of
# [Grain Boundary Smoothing](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainSmoothing_py.html).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Keeping map and grains together
#
# `calcGrains` writes one per-pixel property into the map it was given. The `grainId`
# property records which grain contains each measurement. Almost every map-to-grain
# operation in this chapter needs it, and it is there from the first reconstruction on.

# %%
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=10 * degree, minPixel=5)

# the measurements inside the largest grain
id = np.argmax(grains.numPixel)
ebsd[grains[id]]

# %% [markdown]
# The displayed summary belongs to the measurements in the largest grain, the notIndexed
# pixels the closing absorbed among them, since they keep their phase. The grain object in
# `ebsd[grains[id]]` supplies its stored grain id. That id need not equal its position in
# a shortened or reordered grain list. [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html) develops
# this distinction.
#
# The map contains the same measurement positions, but it is not an untouched copy of the
# import. Removal through `minPixel` rewrites the phase of the affected measurements.
# Reconstructing grains from this map a second time is therefore not meaningful; keep
# `ebsd.copy()` where the original is still needed.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Grain reconstruction in heavily deformed microstructures
#
# Everything above rests on one assumption: that a misorientation between two neighbouring
# pixels means the same thing everywhere on the map. A single threshold should then
# separate "inside a grain" from "across a grain boundary". In a heavily deformed material
# that assumption fails from both sides. Inside a grain the lattice is bent. Small
# neighbour-to-neighbour changes can accumulate to tens of degrees across it. Between two
# grains, the misorientation may be below any threshold one would call high angle.
#
# We use an austenitic steel deformed in situ. It was indexed by spherical pattern matching
# rather than by the Hough transform. Its orientation noise is about 0.1 degree. This is
# roughly one order of magnitude below that of a typical Hough-indexed map, so the
# deformation substructure is resolved.

# angles of interest, it cuts through the bent lattice inside grains. The dense black lines
# in the next figure follow contours of the smooth orientation field rather than physical
# grain boundaries.

# ## Fast multiscale clustering
#
# The way out is to stop asking about pixel pairs in isolation. Fast multiscale clustering,
# `gbcFMC`, builds a hierarchy of progressively coarser pixel aggregates. It fits the
# lattice gradient within each aggregate. It then compares the residual misorientation
# between aggregates with their internal orientation spread. A 1 degree step between two
# uniform aggregates can therefore be a boundary. A comparable step explained by bending
# within one grain is not. FMC has no threshold angle.
#
# The option `fmc` selects this criterion. Its value is `cmaha`. This controls how sharply
# an unexpected residual misorientation suppresses the coupling between two aggregates.
# Larger values return more grains.

# Finally, we apply the same reconstruction to the full map. Unlike a local threshold
# criterion, FMC clusters the entire map at once rather than one pixel pair at a time,
# which is why this takes a few seconds. The `verbose` flag prints how far the hierarchy
# coarsened and the scales from which the final grains were read.

# ## More ways to reconstruct grains
#
# The threshold angle and fast multiscale clustering are two of several criteria by which
# `calcGrains` can separate neighbouring pixels. MTEX represents them as interchangeable
# `grainBoundaryCriterion` objects.
# [Advanced Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstructionAdvanced_py.html) explains
# phase-dependent and soft thresholds. It also covers segmentation by another property and
# custom criteria. [Markovian Clustering](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstructionMCL_py.html) turns criterion
# weights into grains in a second way, by clustering the map instead of taking connected
# components.
#
# Continue with [Plotting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainSpatialPlots_py.html), then
# [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html). The latter uses the `grainId` relationship
# established above. The resulting boundary network is the subject of
# [Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainBoundaries.html).

# ## Technical details
#
# `calcGrains` returns the grains alone and writes `grainId` into the map it was given,
# where MATLAB returns a modified copy of the map as its second output; the phases that
# `minPixel` marks notIndexed are rewritten in that map too, so a sweep over `minPixel` on
# one map passes `ebsd.copy()`. The alpha closing keeps the phase of every pixel it absorbs,
# so the sweep over `alpha` runs on the map itself.
#
# Fast multiscale clustering picks its seeds in order of coupling and aggregate size, and
# the order of the pixels decides between equal values. MATLAB stores this map with y
# running fastest, the port with x. Taken in MATLAB's order, the zoom gives MATLAB's 55 and
# 107 grains at `cmaha` 0.5 and 1.5 and the same hierarchy pair for pair; in the port's own
# order it gives 56 and 113. The full map gives 1903 grains, 1900 in MATLAB's order, for
# MATLAB's 1894, in about 14 seconds for MATLAB's 23.
