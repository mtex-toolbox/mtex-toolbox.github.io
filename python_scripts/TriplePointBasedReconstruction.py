# # Triple-Point-Based Parent Phase Reconstruction
#
# This page reconstructs former beta grains in a titanium alloy from places where three
# measured alpha grains meet. It continues [Grain Graph Based Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainGraphBasedReconstruction_py.html),
# but uses a triple point rather than a boundary between two grains as its first source of
# evidence.

# Groups of related alpha colours already suggest the former beta-grain shapes. The
# reconstruction must turn that visual pattern into a reproducible assignment of parent
# orientations and boundaries.
#
# ## Set the parent-to-child orientation relationship
#
# The Burgers orientation relationship (OR) aligns a beta $(110)$ plane with an alpha
# $(0001)$ plane. It also aligns a beta $[1\bar{1}1]$ direction with an alpha $[\bar{2}110]$
# direction.

# Parent grain reconstruction functions expect the OR in the parent-to-child direction.
# Passing the inverse would produce incorrect candidate parent orientations even if the
# resulting map appeared structured.
#
# ## Segment the child grains
#
# A grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels produced by
# segmentation. Triple-point voting needs three separate child grains, so the initial
# segmentation must not join alpha regions that may have different beta parents.

# %%
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, threshold=1.5 * degree, removeQuadruplePoints=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The deliberately small 1.5-degree threshold keeps such alpha regions separate. The
# [`removeQuadruplePoints`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/QuadruplePoints_py.html) option replaces every four-way junction
# with two three-segment junctions. In this child-phase map, those junctions supply the triple
# points required by the voting algorithm.
#
# A triple point is a junction where exactly three boundary segments meet and separate three
# distinct real grains. It therefore provides three child orientations that can be tested
# against one common parent.

# ## Find unambiguous triple-point seeds
#
# [`calcTPVotes`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcTPVotes.html) asks whether the three child
# orientations at each triple point are variants of one beta orientation. It computes the
# best and second-best common-parent fits.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# Despite their option names, the two limits act in opposite directions. `minFit` requires
# the best fit to be smaller than 2.5 degrees. `maxFit` requires the second-best fit to be
# larger than 5 degrees. A point is therefore retained only when one candidate fits well and
# its nearest competitor fits distinctly worse. This rejects ambiguous triple points that
# support two parent orientations almost equally well.
#
# The remaining evidence is accumulated by child grain in `job.votes`. The first columns of
# `job.votes.parentId` and `job.votes.prob` contain each grain's highest-ranked parent
# candidate and its probability.

# constraint is available.
#
# ## Transform grains supported by triple-point votes
#
# *Transform* is the first reconstruction step. Each accepted child grain is assigned its
# candidate beta orientation and changes from the child phase to the parent phase. It has not
# yet been merged with neighbouring candidates.
#
# [`calcParentFromVote`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcParentFromVote.html) applies the 70%

# The coloured beta candidates occupy much of the map, but unreconstructed regions remain
# between them. The next step grows only from parent-child boundaries, so accepted seeds

#
# ## Grow from parent-child boundaries
#
# [`calcGBVotes`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcGBVotes.html) with `p2c` considers only
# boundaries between a reconstructed parent grain and an unreconstructed child grain. Three
# passes use thresholds of 2.5, 5, and 7.5 degrees. Newly transformed grains can support the

# ## Merge compatible parent fragments
#
# *Merge* is the second reconstruction step. It combines neighbouring transformed grains into

# The parent count drops from 45,133 to 144 because similarly oriented fragments now share one

# preceding map.
#
# ## Merge small inclusions
#
# An inclusion is a grain entirely enclosed by another grain. Some small child grains remain
# as inclusions because they never received a sufficiently confident parent orientation.
#
# The earlier description called these poorly indexed inclusions. Here they are
# unreconstructed indexed child grains; the notIndexed phase is not a reconstruction
# candidate. [`mergeInclusions`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.mergeInclusions.html) absorbs
# inclusions of at most five pixels into their surrounding reconstructed parent grains.

# The parent count drops from 144 to 55 as small inclusions are absorbed. The large parent
# shapes remain, while tiny enclosed child fragments no longer interrupt them. This is a
# topological cleanup, not a new variant choice.
#
# ## Reconstruct beta orientations at individual pixels
#
# So far, the reconstructed beta orientations have been stored as grain means. Reading
# `job.ebsd` calls [`calcParentEBSD`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcParentEBSD.html) and
# returns an EBSD variable with a parent orientation for each transformed child pixel.

# %% [markdown]
# The pixel colours are piecewise consistent with the reconstructed beta grains. The result
# can now be analysed with ordinary EBSD tools while retaining the reconstructed phase and
# grain IDs.
#
# ## Check the per-pixel reconstruction fit
#
# `parentEBSD.fit` is a per-pixel property. It measures the angular mismatch between a
# measured alpha orientation and the child variant predicted from its reconstructed
# beta-grain orientation.
