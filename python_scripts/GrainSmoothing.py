# # Grain Boundary Smoothing
#
# A *grain* is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels produced by
# segmentation. This page assumes that the grains have already been reconstructed as in
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html).
# [Grain Boundary Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryProperties_py.html) introduces the boundary segments
# and their links to the neighbouring pixels.
#
# EBSD data is measured on a regular grid, so a grain boundary comes out of
# [calcGrains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcGrains.html) as a staircase of pixel edges. Every segment runs
# along one of the grid axes, whatever direction the boundary actually has. The staircase
# makes the boundary too long, quantizes its direction to a few values, and makes its
# curvature meaningless.
#
# [smoothBoundary](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.smoothBoundary.html) repairs this geometry.

# %% [markdown]
# The colours distinguish the mean grain orientations. Smoothing changes the polygonal
# outlines, but it does not change the EBSD measurements, their orientations, or which
# measurements belong to each grain.
#
# This page is about choosing and using the smoothing. How the stages work, and the full
# list of algorithms, is covered in [Smoothing Algorithms](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainSmoothingAdvanced_py.html).

# %% [markdown]
# ## What it does
#
# Boundary smoothing has three stages, in this order. It removes the grid staircase,
# resamples the boundary at even spacing, and only then smooths the curve. The first two
# stages are not cosmetic. Smoothing a staircase directly only makes a finer staircase.
#
# The measured boundary is grey below, and the result is magenta.

# %% [markdown]
# The magenta curves cut across the pixel steps while the junction locations remain fixed.
# A staircase along a boundary at 45 degrees is $\sqrt{2}$ times as long as the diagonal
# it represents. The whole map contains many boundary directions, so its measured change
# is data-dependent.

# %% [markdown]
# The direction distribution shows the same grid artifact. The raw boundary follows two
# antipodal grid axes, drawn as four spikes at multiples of 90 degrees. Smoothing spreads
# boundary length into the intervening directions, although some grid-aligned segments
# remain. Each panel has its own radial scale, so compare the angular spread rather than
# the bar heights.

# ## A measurement choice, not recovered truth
#
# Smoothing suppresses a sampling artifact. It cannot recover the unmeasured sub-pixel
# path of the physical boundary. It replaces grid bias with a smaller, method-dependent
# geometric bias.
#
# For quantitative comparisons, use the same reconstruction threshold, filter, and
# smoothing parameter for every map. Report those choices and repeat important
# measurements at nearby settings to check their sensitivity.

# %% [markdown]
# ## How much to smooth
#
# The second argument is the number of smoothing iterations. More iterations give a
# smoother boundary and reduce the scatter around the grid directions. An iteration count
# is not a physical length, so the same count can have a different effect when the
# boundary sampling changes. See the warning about shrinkage below before increasing it.

# %% [markdown]
# One iteration still tracks small pixel-scale bends. More iterations remove those bends,
# but the 25-iteration curve also pulls visibly inward around the small central grain.
# This is the shrinkage discussed next.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Which algorithm - the short version
#
# A [boundaryFilter](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/boundaryFilter.html) selects the algorithm used for the final
# smoothing stage. Two choices cover most practical work.
#
# *Use the default* when the smoothed boundary is for plotting or for measuring directions
# and lengths. It is a fast Laplacian, and it is what `smoothBoundary(grains, 5)` selects
# without being asked.
#
# *Use [taubinFilter](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/taubinFilter.html) when grain areas or shape parameters matter.* A
# Laplacian shrinks. Every iteration pulls a convex region inward, and nothing bounds how
# far. Taubin follows every smoothing pass with a slightly larger unshrinking pass, which
# stops the systematic drift.

# %%
ref = smoothBoundary(grains, 0)   # simplified and resampled, not smoothed
A0 = ref.area
d = np.median(grains.boundary.segLength)
big = A0 > 10 * d ** 2
A0 = A0[big]

grainsLaplace = smoothBoundary(grains, 25)
aL = grainsLaplace.area[big]
grainsTaubin = smoothBoundary(grains, taubinFilter(25))
aT = grainsTaubin.area[big]

print('grain area after 25 iterations')
print(f'  laplaceFilter (default) {100 * np.mean((aL - A0) / A0):+6.2f}% on average, '
      f'{100 * np.min((aL - A0) / A0):+6.1f}% for the worst grain')
print(f'  taubinFilter            {100 * np.mean((aT - A0) / A0):+6.2f}% on average, '

# %% [markdown]
# The reference has passed through simplification and resampling but has zero smoothing
# iterations. The comparison excludes grains with an area no larger than $10 d^2$, where
# $d$ is the median raw segment length. The printed mean and worst cases show that Taubin
# removes the systematic area loss without promising exact area preservation.

# The difference is visible on the grain whose area is closest to 30 square map units. The
# measured staircase is grey, the Laplacian is magenta, and Taubin is blue.

# ## A physical smoothing length
#
# [curvatureFilter](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/curvatureFilter.html) replaces the iteration count with a length: the
# wavelength whose amplitude is reduced by half. Finer detail is attenuated more strongly,
# while coarser detail is preserved more strongly. Because the parameter is a length, it
# has the same meaning for scans made at different step sizes.

# %% [markdown]
# The orange curve removes pixel-scale turns but follows the larger bends of the measured
# boundary. Use one physical smoothing length across scans when their spatial resolutions
# differ.
#
# [huberFilter](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/huberFilter.html) is available for faceted materials. It keeps genuine
# corners sharp instead of rounding them off. It is not a good default; see
# [Smoothing Algorithms](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainSmoothingAdvanced_py.html).

# %% [markdown]
# ## When to switch the first two stages off
#
# Simplification and resampling change the number of boundary segments. A resampled
# segment no longer runs between one specific pair of pixels. Wherever `gB.ebsdId` is read
# per segment, for example to look up the orientations on either side, switch both stages
# off.

# %%
grainsPlain = smoothBoundary(grains, 5, simplify=False, refine=False)

print(f'boundary segments: {len(grains.boundary)} measured, {len(grainsSmooth.boundary)} after smoothing, '
      f'{len(grainsPlain.boundary)} with both steps off')

# %% [markdown]
# Only the last count remains equal to the measured count. It therefore keeps one valid
# `ebsdId` pair for every original pixel-edge segment.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Junctions and triple points
#
# A *junction* is a boundary vertex at which the number of meeting segments is not two. It
# includes triple and quadruple points as well as a loose end. By default,
# `smoothBoundary` holds every junction fixed. Segment connectivity is unchanged, and the
# places where the grains meet remain fixed.
#
# The option `moveTriplePoints` releases the interior junctions despite its narrower name.
# Be careful with a Laplacian: moving those vertices allows a small grain to shrink until
# its polygon collapses. Outer-boundary vertices remain fixed unless `moveOuterBoundary`
# is also passed.

# ## Technical Details
#
# A filter is constructed with parentheses, `taubinFilter(25)` and `curvatureFilter()`,
# and its smoothing length is set on the object. The rose diagram of boundary directions
# is `histogram(v, numBin, weights=)` on a polar axes, MATLAB's `histogram(v, weights, n)`.
# `grains.scanUnit` carries the unit of the map the grains came from.
# MATLAB's zoom `axis([x0 x1 y0 y1])` after a map plot is `region=[x0, x1, y0, y1]` on its
# first plot, in the coordinates of the map whatever the plotting convention.
