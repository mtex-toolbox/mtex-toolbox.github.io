# # RBF-Kernel Approximation from Discrete Data
#
# [Approximating Orientation-Dependent Functions from Discrete Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunApproximationTheory_py.html)
# defines the shared approximation problem and compares harmonic, RBF, and Bingham models.
# This page assumes that an RBF model is appropriate and shows how to choose density
# constraints, kernel halfwidth, centre orientations, and a least-squares solver.
#
# RBF approximation is often useful for an ODF or another density when the number of
# observations and their noise level are not too large. It can also fit a general scalar
# response, but only `'density'` imposes the nonnegativity and mean-1 constraints required
# of a density.

# The broad high-value regions remain visible, but individual markers vary much more than on
# the harmonic page. The noise-free values `S['values']` are retained only so that this
# controlled example can later measure recovery error. They would not be available for an
# unknown experimental response.
#
# ## Fit a density
#
# [interp](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/rotation.interp.html) uses an RBF model by default and calls
# [SO3FunRBF.interpolate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunRBF.interpolate.html). The `'density'` flag selects modified
# least squares, `'mlsq'`. This solver constrains the kernel weights to be nonnegative, and
# MTEX normalizes the fitted function to mean 1.

# The fit retains the broad peaks while smoothing the marker-to-marker fluctuations. Its
# printed minimum and mean verify the density constraints. A nonzero residual is expected
# because a smooth constrained model cannot reproduce every noisy value. If the fit reaches
# the 100-iteration `'mlsq'` limit, its coefficients may not yet be optimal.
#
# ## Fit without density constraints
#
# Omitting `'density'` selects unconstrained LSQR. The kernel grid still smooths the data,
# so the result is not literally "undenoised." It simply has more freedom to reduce the
# sample residual, including by using negative weights or changing the mean.

# The unconstrained residual is smaller, but the printed minimum and mean show that this fit

# are possible overfitting, not evidence that the unconstrained model is physically better.
#
# ## Separate halfwidth from centre spacing
#
# The kernel halfwidth controls how far each centre influences neighbouring orientations. A
# large halfwidth produces a smooth fit. A halfwidth that is small relative to the data
# spacing can reproduce noise.
#
# By default, the `halfwidth` option also sets the resolution of the equispaced centre grid.
# That coupling changes both the kernel shape and the number of unknown weights. Specify
# `resolution` separately when the aim is to isolate the effect of halfwidth.

# The Abel-Poisson fit places its peaks in the same broad regions, but its tails and peak

# separate modelling choices.
#
# ## Exact interpolation
#
# If the values are noise-free, the input orientations themselves can be used as kernel
# centres with `exact=True`. For distinct nodes and a positive-definite kernel, the
# resulting kernel matrix is symmetric and positive definite, so the linear system has a
# unique exact solution.
#
# That matrix is generally dense. Construction, solution, and later evaluation can therefore
# become prohibitively expensive for the complete data set. The example uses a reproducible
# subset to make the cost visible without attempting the original all-node dense system.

# The exact-centre fit follows the noise-free subset closely. Every value moves the weight
# of the kernel at its own node, so noise in the values would go straight into the fit, which
# is why exact interpolation is unsuitable for noisy data. Because these centres are not a
# structured grid, later evaluations are slower than for a grid-centred RBF model.
#
# The iterative solver stops at a requested tolerance or iteration limit, so its computed
# residual need not reach machine precision. Exact centres make an exact solution available;
# they do not force the iterative solver to reach it.

# The printed residual checks how closely this run solved the system. Exact interpolation of
# nonnegative values takes the positive solver here as well, so the minimum stays positive;
# with values of both signs the fit is unconstrained and may become negative.
#
# ## Choose a least-squares solver
#
# The harmonic page introduces LSQR stopping conditions. RBF interpolation uses `tol` and
# `maxIter` in the same spirit, but its defaults depend on the solver: unconstrained `'lsqr'`
# uses at most 30 iterations, whereas density-constrained `'mlsq'` uses at most 100. Both
# default to `tol=1e-3`.
#
# The two solvers serve different constraints:
#
# * `'lsqr'` is the fast default for an unconstrained least-squares fit.
# * `'mlsq'` enforces positive normalized weights and is selected by `'density'`, or by
#   values of one sign at fewer than 10,000 nodes.
#
# With `withIterations=True`, `SO3FunRBF.interpolate` also returns the iteration count, not
# a convergence flag. Compare residuals and fits when the count reaches the selected limit.

# %% [markdown]
# If the second run reaches 100 iterations, it has stopped at `maxIter` rather than satisfying
# the very small tolerance. Increase the limit only when the additional accuracy matters to
# validation or interpretation.
#
# ## The maths behind RBF approximation
#
# An RBF model places one rotational kernel $\Psi$ at each centre $R_n$:
#
# $$ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^N c_n\, \Psi\!\left(\cos\frac{\omega(x,R_n)}{2}\right). $$
#
# Here $\omega(x,R_n)$ is the rotation angle between the evaluation orientation and the
# centre. The coefficients $c_n$ are the unknown weights. With sample pairs $(x_m,v_m)$,
# unconstrained fitting solves
#
# $$ \min_c \lVert Kc-v\rVert_2^2, \qquad
# K_{mn}=\Psi\!\left(\cos\frac{\omega(x_m,R_n)}{2}\right). $$
#
# The kernel matrix is sparse in the usual grid-centred approximation because MTEX neglects
# interactions outside a halfwidth-dependent angular neighbourhood. The `exact` flag
# evaluates every interaction, which is why that matrix loses the computational advantage.
#
# For a density fit, modified least squares additionally requires nonnegative coefficients
# with a prescribed sum. MTEX then normalizes the resulting RBF function to mean 1. These
# constraints explain why a density fit can have a larger sample residual than
# unconstrained LSQR.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB's second output of `SO3FunRBF.interpolate` is `withIterations=True` here. MATLAB
# also offers the solvers `'mlrl'`, `'lsqnonneg'`, `'lsqlin'` and `'nnls'`; the port has
# `'lsqr'` and `'mlsq'`. The noise is drawn by NumPy. MATLAB evaluates a sum of kernels
# through the sparse matrix of the kernel at every point; the port evaluates one of more
# than two million kernel terms through its harmonic form at the bandwidth of the kernel,
# which reproduces the sum to about $4\mathbin{\cdot}10^{-4}$. The residuals at the samples
# cannot fall below that: the tight LSQR run converges in 41 iterations as MATLAB's does,
# which reports a residual norm of $7.9\mathbin{\cdot}10^{-13}$, while the port's evaluation
# gives 0.37. MATLAB's density fits keep 71802, 119075 and 69937 centres where the port's
# keep 73610, 119086 and 69896.
