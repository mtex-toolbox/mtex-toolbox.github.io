# # Options
#
# An MTEX command first receives the arguments it needs to do its job. Optional keyword
# arguments then adjust how that job is done. A flag is an option whose value is `True` or
# `False` and switches a behaviour on or off.
#
# In the following pattern, `data` is a required argument, `resolution` is an option name,
# and `5*degree` is its value. The final `contour=True` is a flag.
#
#     command(data, resolution=5*degree, contour=True)
#
# Options are always optional, may be given in any order, and follow the required arguments.
# This lets you begin with a default call and add only the controls that matter for the
# result you need. The names are MTEX's: MATLAB's `'resolution',5*degree` is
# `resolution=5*degree` here, and MATLAB's flag `'contour'` is `contour=True`.
#
# ## A plotting option in practice
#
# MTEX plotting commands understand the `resolution` option. It specifies how finely a
# continuous function is evaluated before it is drawn. A large angular step makes a coarse
# evaluation grid; a small step makes a fine grid and takes more time.
#
# Compare pole figures of the same orientation density function (ODF), first on a 10 degree
# grid and then on a 2.5 degree grid. An ODF describes how frequently orientations occur in a
# material.

from mtex import *

odf = SantaFe()
h = Miller(1, 0, 0, odf.CS)

newMtexFigure(layout=[1, 2])
plotPF(odf, h, resolution=10 * degree, contour=True, lineWidth=2)
nextAxis()
plotPF(odf, h, resolution=2.5 * degree, contour=True, lineWidth=2)

# %% [markdown]
# Both plots show the same three maxima. On the left, the 10 degree contour lines are visibly
# polygonal because the evaluation grid appears as kinks. On the right, the 2.5 degree
# contour lines are smooth curves. The resolution determines whether the drawing is limited
# by the function or by the grid on which MTEX evaluated it.
#
# The default resolution is a compromise between detail and run time. Use a finer resolution
# when a figure will be published or when the grid is visible in a curve that should be
# smooth.
#
# ## Flags
#
# A flag takes the value `True`. The `contour=True` flag above asks for contour lines instead
# of a smooth colour plot. Flags and other options may be mixed freely and given in any
# order.
#
# Python refuses the same keyword twice in one call. A wrapper that passes on its `**kwargs`
# and still overrides one of its own defaults merges the two dictionaries, the later value
# winning, as MATLAB's rule for a repeated option does:
#
#     def myPlot(odf, h, **kwargs):
#       return plotPF(odf, h, **{'contour': True, **kwargs})
#
# ## Two traps
#
# A misspelt option is not always caught. A command with a fixed set of options, such as
# `calcGrains`, refuses an unknown name:
# `calcGrains(ebsd, theshold=10*degree)` raises
# `TypeError: calcGrains() got an unexpected keyword argument 'theshold'`. The plotting
# commands, however, read the options they know and pass the rest on to matplotlib, which
# ignores what it does not use, so a misspelt plotting option runs and quietly uses the
# default. In MATLAB every command ignores an unknown option; the exact typo above survived
# for years in a published tutorial because the default happened to be the intended value.
# Copy option names rather than typing them.
#
# Options are matched by their exact spelling. The plotting commands accept MATLAB's
# capitalised spellings of the common options as well, `lineWidth` beside `linewidth`, but
# `colourRange` is not an option at all.
#
# ## Finding the accepted names
#
# Each MTEX command lists the options and flags it understands in its own help. For example,
# the help for `calcGrains` shows its signature with every keyword:
#
#     help(calcGrains)
#
# Start with the command's default call, inspect its help, and then append the documented
# names. This workflow avoids silent spelling errors and makes each non-default choice
# visible in the script.
