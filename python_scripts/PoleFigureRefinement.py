# # Successive Refinement of Pole Figure Reconstructions
#
# [ODF Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html) reconstructs an orientation distribution function
# (ODF) on one orientation grid with one kernel width. A kernel is the smooth component
# placed at each grid orientation. Its width sets the smallest scale that the
# reconstruction can represent.
#
# This page refines two different parts of that workflow. First,
# [calcODFIterative](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.calcODFIterative.html) keeps the measurements fixed while
# it successively narrows the kernel. Second, a simulation keeps the reconstruction method
# fixed while it adds measurements where the current ODF predicts high pole density.
#
# Successive kernel refinement is not the same as asking `calcODF` for more solver
# iterations. It changes the representation scale and uses each coarser solution to
# initialise the next one. Neither kind of refinement removes the non-uniqueness of pole
# figure inversion; see [The Ghost Effect](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFAmbiguity_py.html).

# The iterative reconstruction starts from a uniform ODF. It solves first with a wide
# kernel, transfers those weights to a finer grid, narrows the kernel, and solves again.
# The coarse stages suppress fine-scale variation and provide informed starting weights
# for the finer stages.
#
# This scale progression acts as a regularisation strategy for irregularly sampled data.
# It does not replace ghost correction. The `thinning=False` flag retains low-weight grid
# nodes so that this comparison isolates the effect of the changing scale.

# The range from -0.92 to 0.58 is centred at 0.00. Broad, smooth differences extend across
# the sphere instead of concentrating at the texture maxima. Compare the centre of each
# pole figure with its rim.
#
# This is the appearance of a differently distributed uniform portion. It is the part of
# an ODF that pole figures constrain least, which is why a smaller fit error does not
# prove that the reconstructed ODF is closer to the unknown true ODF.

# ## Adapting the measurement
#
# The rest of the page uses a simulation so that the true ODF is known.
# [Simulating Pole Figure Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureSimulation_py.html) develops this validation
# strategy. Here the model has two sharp components, and pole figures can be evaluated at
# whichever specimen directions are selected.

# ## The refinement loop
#
# Each round measures the current directions and merges them with all earlier

# directions inserted by [refine](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.refine.html). Only the quarter with the highest
# predicted intensity is measured in the next round. Five rounds are used here.
#
# This highest-intensity rule is deliberately naive. It exploits the current estimate but
# does not account for uncertainty, counting noise, acquisition cost, or the possibility
# that the current estimate missed a component. It demonstrates adaptive sampling, not a
# general experimental design prescription.

# Every round prints the mean resolution of the three accumulated direction sets. This
# single value summarises an irregular sampling pattern; it does not mean that
# neighbouring points are that far apart everywhere.
#
# The mean resolution falls from 15.3 to 4.3 degrees. The four interim ODF errors are
# 0.82, 1.01, 0.66, and 0.47. They do not fall monotonically: the second round concentrates
# the new directions on the predicted maxima before the reconstruction has located them
# accurately. A real experiment could not compute these errors because its true ODF is
# unknown.
#
# That non-monotonicity is the point of the demonstration. The measurement is now dense
# where the texture is strong and coarse everywhere else. An ordinary fine-grid
# reconstruction then puts ODF components at orientations that the sparse regions do not
# constrain.

# ## Next
#
# [Simulating Pole Figure Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureSimulation_py.html) adds counting noise and asks
# how many pole figures a reconstruction needs. Then return to
# [The Ghost Effect](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFAmbiguity_py.html) for the information that no refinement
# of measurement density can recover.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Technical Details
#
# `union` takes `None` for the empty data set MATLAB starts from, and `pf_measured[l]` is
# MATLAB's `pf_measured{l}`. `calcODFIterative` prints its ladder of grids and fit errors
# with `silent=False`.
#
# Two things make the refinement loop take a different path from MATLAB's. A pole figure
# derives the resolution of its specimen directions from the points, as the square root of
# the median area of their Voronoi cells, where MATLAB remembers the spacing the grid was
# built with, so the first round reports 15.3 degrees rather than 14.5. And `refine` keeps
# a cap a cap: it returns the centroids of the Delaunay triangles of the points, none below
# the lowest one, where MATLAB closes the hull with the south pole and keeps the centroids
# of the skirt triangles as well. The accumulated measurement therefore ends at 327
# directions per pole figure rather than 367, all of them inside the measured cap.
