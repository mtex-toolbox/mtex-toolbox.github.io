# # Exporting Vectors
#
# [export](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.export.html) writes a `vector3d` array as a whitespace-separated text
# table. Each vector occupies one row, and the first row names the columns.
# [vector3d.load](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.load.html) can read the table back, so the format is useful for
# another program or a later MTEX session.
#
# This page assumes that Cartesian components, polar angle, and azimuth are familiar. See
# [Defining Three-Dimensional Vectors](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorDefinition_py.html) for their definitions.

# five unit directions with distinct polar angles and azimuths

# The examples deliberately reuse the same temporary filename. Each call to `export`
# replaces the file instead of appending rows.

# %%
fname = os.path.join(tempfile.mkdtemp(), 'vectors.txt')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Cartesian Coordinates
#
# By default, `export` writes the stored $x$, $y$, and $z$ components. Cartesian export
# retains vector-length information.

# %%
export(v, fname)
print(open(fname).read())

# %% [markdown]
# The heading identifies the three coordinate columns. The next five rows are the five
# vectors in array order.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Spherical Angles
#
# The option `'polar'` writes polar angle and azimuth instead. Angles are in degrees by
# default; add `radians=True` to write radians.
#
# This representation contains directions only. It does not include vector length, so use
# Cartesian coordinates when magnitudes matter.

# %%
export(v, fname, 'polar')
print(open(fname).read())

# %% [markdown]
# The two headings remain `polar angle` and `azimuth angle` for either angular unit. Record
# the unit with the file because the table does not.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Additional Columns
#
# Values that belong to the vectors, such as an intensity, weight, or density, can travel
# in the same table. Pass them in a dict with one value per vector. Each entry becomes a
# column with its key as the heading.

# %%
S = {'weight': np.arange(1, 6) / 15}

# %%
export(v, fname, S)
print(open(fname).read())

# %% [markdown]
# The `weight` column is fourth, and its row order remains aligned with the Cartesian
# coordinates.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading the File Back
#
# Supply every column name to recover both the vectors and their associated values.
# `loadVector3d` returns the columns that are not coordinates as its second output, a dict
# like the one that was written.

# %%
vNew, SNew = loadVector3d(fname, columnNames=['x', 'y', 'z', 'weight'])

# %%
maxAngleError = np.max(angle(v, vNew)) / degree
maxAngleError

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
maxWeightError = np.max(np.abs(S['weight'] - SNew['weight']))
maxWeightError

# %% [markdown]
# The maximum angular error is $3.3461 \times 10^{-5}$ degrees, and the maximum weight
# error is $3.3333 \times 10^{-7}$. Both come from the six significant digits written by
# the default `%g` numeric format rather than from the in-memory values.

# %%
# remove the temporary file
os.remove(fname)

# ## What the Table Does Not Record
#
# A reference frame is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. It has an
# identity, a basis, and a default convention for drawing it. The text table records none
# of these, and it does not say whether opposite directions represent the same physical
# axis. Keep that information with the exported file before exchanging or archiving it.
#
# For a higher-precision text representation, extract the coordinate arrays and use a
# writer with an explicit numeric format.

#
# [Import](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorsImport_py.html) develops column mappings and associated data in more detail.
# Continue through this chapter with [Vector Operations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorsOperations_py.html). To save a
# whole figure rather than its underlying data, read

# ## Technical Details
#
# The azimuth written by `'polar'` is derived from the components and lies in
# $[0, 360)$ degrees, so the two negative azimuths above appear as $280$ and $320$. MATLAB
# remembers the angle a vector was constructed with and writes $-80$ and $-40$; the
# directions are the same.
