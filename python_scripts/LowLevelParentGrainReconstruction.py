# # Low-Level Parent Phase Reconstruction
#
# This page rebuilds the triple-point workflow from
# [Triple-Point-Based Parent Phase Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TriplePointBasedReconstruction_py.html) with
# low-level functions. It exposes the candidate variant IDs, vote counts, grain-ID remapping,
# and per-pixel parent calculation that the `parentGrainReconstructor` normally manages.
#
# Use this route when you need to inspect or replace one of those operations. For a routine
# reconstruction, the higher-level workflow is shorter and less vulnerable to inconsistent
# bookkeeping.

# * Strict seed support: at least three agreeing votes.
# * Seed-fragment merge: below 2.5 degrees and at least two child grains per proposed parent
#   component. The merge may be skipped if the separate fragments are needed.
# * Parent-child pair fit and growth merge: 5 degrees.
#
# The earlier summary listed a minimum of two consistent votes and a 2.5-degree alpha-beta
