# # Random Sampling
#
# An [orientation distribution function](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html) describes a continuous
# population of orientations. This page solves the reverse problem to
# [density estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html): it turns an ODF into a finite list of
# orientations that represents that population. The ODF may have been built as a model
# or reconstructed from pole-figure measurements.
#
# There are two different reasons to do this. A random sample represents sampling
# variability, for example in a bootstrap or a synthetic measurement. An optimized sample
# represents the ODF with as few points as possible, for example as input to a
# crystal-plasticity calculation. These point sets may look similar, but they are not
# interchangeable. Sampling from a model also gives a known answer for testing a density
# estimation method. Crystal-plasticity codes such as VPSC also consume orientation lists
# in this form.
#
# The examples use a trigonal ODF made from a randomly chosen fibre on a uniform
# background.

# ## Draw a Random Sample
#
# [discreteSample](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.discreteSample.html) draws orientations with probability
# proportional to the ODF. Each orientation in the returned list has the same implicit
# weight, $1/500$ in this example.

# The black circles gather around the high-density parts of the coloured ODF. Their
# apparent crowding is not a statistical test, however. Section coordinates and
# projections distort area, while an ODF lives in a three-dimensional orientation space.
#
# Sigma sections organize this trigonal example more directly and make the fibre easier
# to follow. They provide a better visual comparison, but they do not remove the need for
# a quantitative error measure.

# %% [markdown]
# In the sigma sections, the black points trace the elongated high-density feature rather
# than filling orientation space uniformly. Random clusters and gaps remain because this
# is only one realization of 500 points.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reconstruct the ODF from the Random Sample
#
# A reconstruction converts the point set back to an ODF. Comparing it with the known
# model measures how well the sample represents the original. Here
# [calcError](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcError.html) is asked explicitly for the $L^1$ error. The
# sample-size experiment below uses relative $L^2$ error because that norm is cheap for
# harmonic ODFs. Compare errors within each experiment, not across the two different
# norms.
#
# The reconstruction also introduces a kernel halfwidth. A small halfwidth retains
# sample-scale variation; a large one smooths that variation but also broadens real
# texture features.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# At $10^\circ$, individual clusters and gaps appear as narrow peaks and troughs. The
# reconstruction shows the finite sample at least as strongly as it shows the underlying

# At $20^\circ$, the estimate is smoother and closer to the original for this

# ## Place an Optimized Sample
#
# Random points are appropriate when the realization itself is part of the experiment,
# such as a bootstrap study of measurement accuracy. When the aim is instead a compact
# numerical representation, use [optimalSample](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.optimalSample.html). It moves the
# orientations to reduce their discrepancy from the ODF rather than drawing independent
# observations.

# at the same sample size. This usually reduces the error, but it does not turn the
# points into random observations. Use random samples to model variability and optimized
# samples as compact numerical input.

# ## Optimizing the Weights Too
#
# The sample above gives every orientation the same weight. Requesting the weights as
# well also optimizes them,
#
# `ori, c = odf.optimalSample(500, optimizeWeights=True)`
#
# The nonnegative weights sum to one and are volume fractions. Pass them to the
# reconstruction as `calcDensity(ori, weights=c)`. The ODF is then represented by a
# weighted sum of point masses. Optimizing one weight per orientation adds degrees of
# freedom, so fewer orientations can represent the same ODF to a given accuracy.
#
# Whether weighted points help depends on the reconstruction halfwidth and on the
# harmonic `bandwidth` used by `optimalSample`. The bandwidth says which harmonic degrees
# the optimization controls. Choose it for the intended use of the points; the
# [optimalSample](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.optimalSample.html) reference gives the details.

# %% [markdown]
# ## How Sample Size Changes the Best Halfwidth
#
# The comparison above fixed both the sample size and the reconstruction halfwidth. A
# fair comparison over several sizes must tune the halfwidth separately for every
# sample. The following controlled experiment gives each point set the kernel that
# minimizes its relative $L^2$ error, then compares the resulting errors.
#
# The search bracket reaches to 80 degrees, well above the halfwidth any of these sample
# sizes calls for. A bracket that the smallest samples can reach would clip their optimum
# and bias the fitted laws.
#
# These fitted laws describe this model ODF over the tested sizes. They are not universal
# prescriptions for another texture.

# ## The Asymptotic Halfwidth Rule
#
# For comparison, the `'magicRule'` in [calcKernel](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.calcKernel.html) sets the
# parameter of the [de la Vallee Poussin kernel](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3DeLaValleePoussinKernel.html) to
# $\kappa \sim M^{2/7}$. Since its halfwidth behaves like $\delta \sim \kappa^{-1/2}$,
# the rule corresponds to $\delta \sim M^{-1/7} \approx M^{-0.14}$.
#
# This is the classical asymptotic kernel-density rate on a three-dimensional space. The
# fitted exponents above are steeper without contradicting that result: they cover less
# than two decades of $M$ and a model ODF that is half uniform. The comparison between
# the samplers is the useful result because both were measured in the same way.
#
# The halfwidth rules in `calcKernel` are derived for random samples. They will therefore
# oversmooth an optimized sample.

# ## Approximation Error versus Sample Size

# Once every sample has its own optimal halfwidth, compare the minimum relative $L^2$
# errors and fit a power law to each sampler.

# ## Limits of the Comparison
#
# These numbers belong to the model ODF on this page. Neither prefactors nor exponents
# carry over unchanged to another ODF. The prefactors scale with the halfwidth of the
# true ODF, and the fitted exponents become flatter for a sharper texture.
#
# The robust qualitative result is the structure of the comparison: the best halfwidths
# have similar exponents, while the optimized sample works with a kernel about one third
# sharper in this experiment. Its advantage is also limited by the harmonic `bandwidth`
# used during optimization. Once a reconstruction depends on degrees beyond that
# bandwidth, the optimization no longer controls its error and the curves approach each
# other again.

# A sampled orientation list can be exported as [Euler angles](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationDefinition_py.html)
# with [export](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/quaternion.export.html). Crystal-plasticity programs often require a
# particular convention and a weight in every row. Use
# [export](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.export_VPSC.html) with `interface='VPSC'` for the VPSC format.

# orientation lists is covered in [ODF Export](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFExport_py.html).
