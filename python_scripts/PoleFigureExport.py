# # Export Pole Figure Data
#
# [export](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.export.html) writes the sampled directions and intensities of a
# `PoleFigure` to plain ASCII tables. This page exports measured data, reads it back, and
# then exports pole figures recalculated from an orientation distribution function (ODF).
#
# The tables are easy to exchange, but they are not a self-describing file format. Keep
# the crystal and specimen frames, symmetries, angular unit, Miller indices, and
# superposition coefficients with the files. Importing these quantities is introduced in
# [Import Pole Figure Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureImport_py.html). The meaning of a pole figure is
# explained in [Pole Figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureAnalysis.html).

# ## Start with measured pole figures
#
# The Dubna quartz data set contains seven pole-figure entries. Its specimen frame is
# drawn with Y pointing up and X pointing right.
#
# The summary lists one row per entry. An entry may represent one crystal direction or a
# superposition of directions whose diffraction peaks could not be resolved. The third
# Dubna entry is such a superposition, so seven entries do not necessarily mean seven
# individual reflections.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Write one file per entry
#
# Different pole figures may be measured on different specimen grids.
# [export](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.export.html) therefore writes each entry to a separate file instead
# of assuming one common list of specimen directions. The file name combines the base name
# below with the entry's Miller indices.

# %%
# write into a temporary folder
fname = os.path.join(tempfile.mkdtemp(), 'dubna')
written = export(pf, fname, 'degree')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inspect the files
#
# List the generated files, then show the beginning of the first table.

# %%
d = sorted(glob.glob(fname + '_*.txt'))
print(f'Exported {len(d)} files:')
for name in d:
  print('    ' + os.path.basename(name))

preview = np.loadtxt(d[0])
print('Rows from three successive polar rings: angle, azimuth, intensity')
print(preview[[0, 1, 2]])

# %% [markdown]
# Every row has three columns: the polar angle of the specimen direction, its azimuth
# angle, and the measured diffraction intensity. The `'degree'` option writes both angles
# in degrees; without it, `export` writes radians.
#
# The files contain numbers only. In particular, they do not contain column labels,
# angular units, crystal or specimen symmetry, crystal-frame alignment, specimen-frame
# identity, or superposition coefficients. The Miller indices appear in the file name, but
# a naming convention is not a substitute for metadata. When sharing the tables, include a
# script or README that records these choices and explains how specimen X, Y, and Z
# correspond to the physical sample.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Read the data back
#
# The three columns are exactly those understood by
# the generic reader of [loadPoleFigure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/loadPoleFigure_generic.html). To reconstruct the object,
# [PoleFigure.load](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.load.html) also needs the Miller indices, crystal and
# specimen symmetries, and superposition coefficients that were not stored in the tables.

# %%
# reconstruct the file names from the Miller indices
fnames = [f'{fname}_{h.char()}.txt' for h in pf.allH]

pf2 = PoleFigure.load(fnames, pf.allH, pf.CS, pf.SS, superposition=pf.c,

# ## Check the round trip
#
# ASCII output has finite decimal precision. Report the largest intensity change
# introduced by writing and reading the tables.

# %%
roundTripError = np.max(np.abs(pf.intensities - pf2.intensities))
print(f'Maximum absolute intensity change: {roundTripError:.3g}')

# %% [markdown]
# For these files the printed maximum intensity change is zero. The specimen directions
# and intensities therefore survive to the printed precision. The regular
# $72 \times 19 = 1368$ grid structure does not: each reloaded entry stores the same 1368
# specimen directions as a plain list. This makes no difference to MTEX computations that
# use those directions, but software that needs the original row-and-column layout must
# reconstruct it from separately recorded acquisition information.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Plot the reloaded data

# %%
plot(pf2, figSize='small')

# %% [markdown]
# The seven panels retain the measured bands, maxima, and angular coverage. A plot is a
# useful check for swapped angle columns, wrong angular units, or a mismatched specimen
# frame. It cannot reveal missing symmetry or superposition metadata when the numeric
# values themselves are unchanged.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Export recalculated pole figures
#
# The same command exports pole figures computed from an ODF with
# [calcPoleFigure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcPoleFigure.html). This is useful when another program needs
# directional pole-density samples rather than the ODF itself.

# %%
odf = calcODF(pf)

pfSim = calcPoleFigure(odf, pf.allH, pf.allR, superposition=pf.c)

# %% [markdown]
# Superposition coefficients must be passed explicitly. The third Dubna pole figure
# combines $(10\bar{1}1)$ and $(01\bar{1}1)$ with the weights in `pf.c[2]`. Without them,
# `calcPoleFigure` would average the two contributions with equal default weights and
# calculate different intensities.

# %%
recalculatedName = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(fname), 'dubnaRecalculated')
writtenSim = export(pfSim, recalculatedName, 'degree')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Clean up
#
# Remove the temporary files after the inspection and round-trip check.

# %%
for name in glob.glob(fname + '_*.txt') + glob.glob(recalculatedName + '_*.txt'):

# ## Choose the quantity to exchange
#
# Export pole figures when the receiving program needs intensities or pole densities
# sampled over specimen directions. If the starting quantity is an ODF, exporting only
# selected pole figures discards information: a finite set of pole figures does not
# determine an ODF uniquely. Use [ODF Export](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFExport_py.html) when the receiving program
# can accept an ODF or a discrete representation of it.

# [ODF Analysis](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFAnalysis.html) develops the continuous quantity usually reconstructed
# from measured pole figures. Continue to [ODF Export](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFExport_py.html) to compare its
# component, grid, and discrete-orientation formats.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Technical Details
#
# `export` dispatches on the kind of object it is given, so the same verb writes a map, an
# orientation list, an ODF or a pole figure data set; it returns the names it wrote. The
# rows of a file run along the polar angle first, so the first three share an azimuth and
# lie on three successive rings; MATLAB writes the same grid down its columns, where the
# three successive rings are the rows 1, 73 and 145. The round trip is exact either way.
# The generic reader takes degrees unless `radians=True` is given, where MATLAB needs
# `'degree'` on reading too.
