# # MTEX for Python developers
#
# This page is for readers who know Python and want to use MTEX inside their own code: a
# package, a pipeline or a notebook that also uses NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib. It says where
# MTEX follows Python's conventions, where it deliberately does not, and how to use it
# cleanly as a library.
#
# ## Why the names follow MATLAB
#
# MTEX has been a MATLAB toolbox for twenty years. Its commands (`calcGrains`, `plotPF`,
# `symmetrise`), its classes (`vector3d`, `orientation`, `crystalFrame`) and its options
# (`minPixel`, `antipodal`) are the vocabulary of its documentation, of the papers that use
# it and of the forum answers. The Python port keeps that vocabulary, so every page of this
# documentation exists in both languages and a MATLAB script translates line by line
# ([MTEX in MATLAB and in Python](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MATLABtoPython_py.html)). The price is a naming style that
# differs from PEP 8: commands and properties are in camelCase, and most classes start with
# a lower case letter. Libraries that mirror an established system do the same, PySide's
# `setWindowTitle` or SimpleITK's `ReadImage`.
#
# Where a MATLAB name is a misnomer, a duplicate, a workaround for a limit of MATLAB or a
# typo, Python has a better one and only that: `plotPF` for `plotPF`, which draws no density
# when given orientations, keywords written positively as `thinning=False` for the flag
# `'nothinning'`, and one spelling `tol=` for a tolerance. The page
# [MTEX in MATLAB and in Python](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MATLABtoPython_py.html) lists them.
#
# Everything below the names is ordinary Python: NumPy arrays, keyword arguments, exceptions,
# docstrings and matplotlib figures.
#
# ## Importing
#
# The pages of this documentation start with `from mtex import *`, which keeps the examples
# short and close to MATLAB. In code of your own, import the module or the names you use:

# %%
import numpy as np
import mtex
from mtex import calcGrains, degree, mtexdata

# %% [markdown]
# The package has one flat namespace: every public command, class and constant is an
# attribute of `mtex`, whichever of its layers (`mtex.geometry`, `mtex.functions`,
# `mtex.maps`, ...) defines it.

# %%
mtex.orientation is mtex.geometry.orientation

# %% [markdown]
# A star import brings in `min`, `max`, `sum` and `round` too. They act on MTEX objects and
# fall back to Python's built-ins on everything else, so plain values behave as before:

# %%
from mtex import max as mtexMax
mtexMax([1, 3, 2]), mtexMax(1, 5), mtexMax(x * x for x in range(4))

# %% [markdown]
# Importing MTEX takes about 0.2 s above NumPy. SciPy's heavier modules, numba, matplotlib,
# h5py and PySide6 are imported only by the commands that need them.
#
# ## Installation extras
#
# The core needs NumPy, SciPy and finufft. The rest are extras of the `mtex` package:
#
# | Extra | Adds | For |
# |---|---|---|
# | `numba` | numba | the compiled kernels; without it the NumPy forms run, slower |
# | `io` | h5py | the vendors' HDF5 files |
# | `plot` | matplotlib | every plot |
# | `plot3d` | PyVista | the 3D scenes of volume maps |
# | `wizard` | PySide6 | the import wizard |
#
# A library that only computes can depend on `mtex[numba]` and leave the drawing out.
#
# ## Containers are NumPy arrays
#
# Every MTEX list, a list of vectors, rotations, orientations or Miller indices, holds one
# NumPy array of shape `(..., k)`: `k` coordinates per element and any shape in front. The
# container's own shape is the shape in front; one element is a container of shape `()`.

# %%
v = mtex.vector3d(np.random.default_rng(0).random((4, 3)))
v.shape, v.data.shape, v[0].shape

# %% [markdown]
# `data` is the stored array: quaternions for rotations, xyz for vectors. The coordinates a
# reader expects have their own properties and commands:

# %%
r = mtex.rotation.byEuler(10 * degree, 20 * degree, 30 * degree)
v.xyz.shape, r.data, r.matrix()

# %% [markdown]
# The containers index, reshape and broadcast as NumPy arrays do, and elementwise products
# broadcast their shapes:

# %%
R = mtex.rotation.rand(5, rng=np.random.default_rng(1))
(R * v.reshape(4, 1)).shape

# %% [markdown]
# NumPy sees a container as its stored coordinates: `np.asarray(v)` is `v.data` without a
# copy, so a container can be handed to any function that takes an array. The arithmetic
# stays with MTEX: an array times a container is the container's product, and NumPy's
# elementwise functions (`np.sqrt`, `np.isnan`, ...) refuse a container rather than act on
# its coordinates.

# %%
np.asarray(v) is v.data, type(np.full(4, 2.0) * v).__name__

# %% [markdown]
# Build a container back from an array with its constructor.
#
# ## Properties and methods
#
# A property is a stored or cheaply derived value and is written without parentheses; every
# `is...` predicate is a property too. A computation is a method with parentheses, and is
# also a module command:

# %%
ebsd = mtexdata('forsterite')
ori = ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations[0:3]
ori.antipodal, ori.angle(), mtex.angle(ori)

# %% [markdown]
# Options are keyword arguments with their MTEX names. A positional string names something:
# the kind of Miller indices, an Euler convention, an alignment.

# %%
mtex.Miller(1, 1, 0, ori.CS, 'uvw', antipodal=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Every public command, class and method has a docstring, so `help(calcGrains)`, the
# editor's hover and completion work. The methods MTEX attaches to classes from other
# modules are declared in the class bodies, so a static type checker and an editor see
# them without running the package.
#
# ## Frames are compared by identity
#
# A crystal or specimen frame is a handle: constructing the same frame twice returns the
# same object, and MTEX compares frames with `is`. Objects carry their frames, and the
# frames carry the point group.

# %%
mtex.crystalFrame('m-3m', mineral='Iron') is mtex.crystalFrame('m-3m', mineral='Iron')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Commands that change their input
#
# Most commands return new objects. The exception to know is `calcGrains`, which writes the
# grain ids and the pixels it removes or absorbs into the map it is given. Pass a copy when
# the original must stay as it was:

# %%
grains = calcGrains(ebsd.copy(), angle=10 * degree, minPixel=5)
len(grains)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Session state
#
# MTEX keeps one session per Python process: the preferences of `setMTEXpref` and the
# register of frames. A preference changes the behaviour of every caller in the process.
# The preferences a user saves with `save=True` go to `mtex_settings.json` and are read at
# import; a library or a test that must see the defaults whatever the user saved sets the
# environment variable `MTEX_SETTINGS` to an empty string before importing MTEX. `mtex.reset()`
# returns the session to its defaults; a preference that is not set prints as `None`.

# %%
mtex.setMTEXpref('kernels', 'numpy')
mtex.getMTEXpref('kernels')

# %%
mtex.reset()
print(mtex.getMTEXpref('kernels'))

# %% [markdown]
# The preference `threads` sets the threads of numba, finufft and `scipy.fft`; by default it
# is the number of physical cores. The compiled kernels can be called from several Python
# threads at once.
#
# ## Plots are matplotlib
#
# The plotting commands draw with matplotlib and return its artists. `parent=` draws into
# an axes of your own, so MTEX plots sit beside any other matplotlib content:

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, (left, right) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
mtex.plot(ebsd['Forsterite'], ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations, parent=left)
right.hist(grains.grainSize, bins=30)
right.set_xlabel('pixels per grain')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Stability
#
# The names of commands, classes and options are fixed from 1.0 on; internals, everything
# whose name starts with an underscore and the modules not re-exported by `mtex`, can change
# between releases.
