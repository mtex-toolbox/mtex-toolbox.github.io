# # Axes and Antipodal Symmetry
#
# A *direction* distinguishes its two ends: north is not south. An *axis* does not. A
# plane normal is an axis when the two sides of the plane are physically equivalent.
# Reversing the axis of a twofold rotation likewise describes the same $180^\circ$
# rotation.
#
# MTEX represents directions and axes with [vector3d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.vector3d.html). The logical
# property `antipodal` records the difference. When it is true, `v` and `-v` represent the
# same axis.
#
# This page assumes the vector construction and angle conventions from
# [Defining Three-Dimensional Vectors](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorDefinition_py.html) and
# [Vector Operations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorsOperations_py.html). See
# [Spherical Projections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SphericalProjections_py.html) if upper- and lower-hemisphere plots
# are new to you.

# ## Plotting Directions and Axes
#
# Take two directions that differ only in the sign of their z coordinate.

# %%
v1 = vector3d(1, 1, 2)
v2 = vector3d(1, 1, -2)

plot(cat(v1, v2), label=['v_1', 'v_2'], grid=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The labels appear on different hemisphere plots. Selecting only the upper hemisphere
# would hide `v2`. It would not turn either direction into an axis.

# %%
plot(cat(v1, v2), label=['v_1', 'v_2'], antipodal=True, grid=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The plotting option represents both inputs on the upper hemisphere, using `-v2` for the
# second one. The two points remain separated because `v1` and `v2` are different axes.
# This option affects this plot only; it does not change either input variable.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Angles and Axial Means
#
# The [angle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.angle.html) between directed vectors ranges from $0^\circ$ to
# $180^\circ$. The angle between axes is measured to whichever end is closer and is
# therefore never greater than $90^\circ$.

# %%
directedAngle = angle(v1, v2) / degree
directedAngle

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
axisAngle = angle(v1, v2, antipodal=True) / degree
axisAngle

# %% [markdown]
# The directed angle is $109.4712^\circ$, whereas the axial angle is $70.5288^\circ$. The
# two add to $180^\circ$. Forgetting `antipodal` produces a plausible but obtuse answer
# instead of an error.
#
# Signs matter for an ordinary mean as well. Two opposite unit directions cancel, while
# the same observations interpreted as axes have a mean axis.

# %%
directedMeanLength = norm(mean(cat(vector3d.X, -vector3d.X)))
directedMeanLength

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
axisMeanMisfit = angle(mean(cat(vector3d.X, -vector3d.X), antipodal=True), vector3d.X, antipodal=True) / degree
axisMeanMisfit

# %% [markdown]
# The directed mean has length 0. The axial mean is aligned with the X axis, so its axial
# misfit is $0^\circ$. The [mean](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.mean.html) of axes uses their unoriented lines
# rather than averaging signed components.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Attaching the Flag to the Data
#
# Repeating an option at every call is unnecessary. Attach the flag by assigning the
# property. The `vector3d` constructor also accepts `antipodal=True`.

# %%
v2.antipodal = True

storedAxisAngle = angle(v1, v2) / degree
storedAxisAngle

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
sameAxis = (v2 == -v2)
sameAxis

# %% [markdown]
# The stored flag gives the same $70.5288^\circ$ angle without an option and makes
# `v2 == -v2` true. For a binary operation, an antipodal flag on either operand requests
# the axial interpretation.
#
# One `vector3d` variable carries one `antipodal` value for its entire array. Do not mix
# directed observations and axes in the same variable. Separate them before calculating
# angles, means, or densities.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Densities of Axes
#
# [Density Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorsDensityEstimation_py.html) turns a list of directions into a
# continuous function on the sphere. These 100 deterministic directions form a short band
# in the upper hemisphere.

# %%
rho = np.linspace(20, 70, 100) * degree
theta = np.linspace(10, 30, 100) * degree
v = vector3d.byPolar(theta, rho)

directionDensity = v.calcDensity(halfwidth=10 * degree)
plot(directionDensity, complete=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The upper hemisphere contains the concentration band. The lower one has no
# point-reflected copy because these observations are still directions.

# %%
axisDensity = v.calcDensity(antipodal=True, halfwidth=10 * degree)
plot(axisDensity, complete=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The lower hemisphere now repeats the upper pattern through the centre of the sphere. An
# axial density must satisfy $f(v)=f(-v)$.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Measured Pole Figures
#
# Under Friedel's law, opposite reflections have equal intensities when the crystal is
# centrosymmetric or resonant scattering is absent. Conventional pole-figure measurements
# normally use this axial model. Resonant scattering can distinguish the signs. Antipodal
# symmetry is therefore an experimental assumption rather than a property of every ODF.
#
# The [Pole Figure Tutorial](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureTutorial_py.html) introduces measured pole figures
# and the experiment behind them.

# %%
pf = mtexdata('dubna')

CS = pf.CS

plot(pf[0])

# %% [markdown]
# MTEX draws this measured pole figure on the upper hemisphere because its specimen
# directions already represent axes. The lower hemisphere would repeat the same
# measurements.

# %%
annotate(vector3d(1, 0, -1), labeled=True, backgroundColor='w')

# %% [markdown]
# Although the annotated direction points downwards, its equivalent upper endpoint is
# labelled in the plot.

# ## Pole Figures Computed from an ODF
#
# A pole figure computed from an ODF need not be antipodal. The quartz point group `321`
# does not contain inversion, and the model below does not impose Friedel's law. The
# [Pole Figures of an ODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFPoleFigure_py.html) page develops this calculation.

# %%
center = orientation.byEuler(20 * degree, 30 * degree, 0, 'ZYZ', CS)
odf = unimodalODF(center)
h = Miller(1, 2, 2, CS)

plotPF(odf, cat(h, -h))

# %% [markdown]
# The two pole figures have different intensity patterns. The ODF distinguishes the
# $(122)$ plane normal from its opposite for this non-Laue point group.

# %%
plotPF(odf, h, antipodal=True)

# %% [markdown]
# With antipodal symmetry imposed, MTEX draws only the upper hemisphere. The omitted lower
# hemisphere is now a point-reflected copy.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inverse Pole Figures
#
# An inverse pole figure fixes a specimen direction and displays crystal directions. The
# [Inverse Pole Figures of an ODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFInversePoleFigure_py.html) page explains this
# complementary view.

# %%
plotIPF(odf, cat(vector3d.Y, -vector3d.Y), complete=True, axisLabels=False)

# %% [markdown]
# The complete inverse pole figures for Y and -Y differ. Without an antipodal assumption,
# reversing the specimen direction changes the question.

# %%
plotIPF(odf, vector3d.Y, antipodal=True, complete=True, axisLabels=False)

# %% [markdown]
# The complete antipodal plot repeats the same crystal-direction pattern on opposite sides
# of the sphere.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Fundamental Sectors
#
# Inverse pole figures are usually reduced to the
# [fundamental sector](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/FundamentalSector_py.html). This is the patch of the sphere that
# crystal symmetry leaves inequivalent.

# %%
plotIPF(odf, vector3d.Y)

# %% [markdown]
# Without antipodal symmetry, MTEX must retain the larger fundamental sector of point group
# `321`.

# %%
plotIPF(odf, vector3d.Y, antipodal=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Identifying opposite directions reduces the region further. Every omitted crystal
# direction is equivalent to one inside the smaller plotted sector.
