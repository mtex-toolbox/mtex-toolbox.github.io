# # Ghost Correction
#
# Pole figures do not contain the odd-order harmonic coefficients of an orientation
# distribution function (ODF). A reconstruction must therefore choose those coefficients
# without help from the measurements. See
# [Ambiguity of Pole Figure Inversion](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFAmbiguity_py.html) for the
# demonstration and [Harmonic Representation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunHarmonicRepresentation_py.html) for the
# coefficient description.
#
# Setting the unknown odd-order coefficients to zero is a safe mathematical choice, but
# it has a visible cost. Real texture components become too weak and sit on a uniform
# background that is too high. Spurious components may also appear beside them. These
# inversion artefacts are called *ghosts*; they are not measurement noise.
#
# Matthies' remedy is to estimate the uniform portion of the ODF first. He called this
# portion the *phon*. MTEX estimates it from the low-intensity tail of the pole figures,
# subtracts it, and reconstructs the sharper remainder. Non-negativity then constrains the
# missing odd-order coefficients more strongly. [calcODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.calcODF.html)
# applies this correction by default.
#
# Ghost correction adds a physical preference; it does not recover information that
# diffraction measured. It matters most for weak textures with a substantial uniform
# portion. Sharp textures have less to gain because non-negativity already constrains
# them strongly.
#
# This page isolates the effect with a known model that is nine tenths uniform. It
# assumes the reconstruction workflow from [ODF Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html) and
# the ODF normalization from [ODF Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html).

# ## Simulate the pole figures
#
# The experiment samples three lattice-plane normals on an antipodal specimen-direction
# grid with 5 degree spacing. These synthetic pole figures now stand in for measurements,
# while the true ODF remains known.

# %%
# specimen directions
r = equispacedS2Grid(resolution=5 * degree, antipodal=True)

# crystal directions
h = Miller([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]], cs)

# compute pole figures
pf = calcPoleFigure(odf, h, r)

# %% [markdown]
# Each pole figure has one broad maximum on a nearly uniform background. The weak
# contrast is exactly the situation in which the uniform portion can hide missing
# odd-order information.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reconstruct with and without correction
#
# The `ghostCorrection=False` flag disables the default correction.

rec = calcODF(pf, ghostCorrection=False)

# Omitting that flag gives the corrected reconstruction.

# ## Compare the fits to the pole figures
#
# [calcError](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.calcError.html) returns one RP error per pole figure. First
# evaluate the reconstruction without correction.

# %%
rpUncorrected = calcError(pf, rec, 'RP')
rpUncorrected

# %% [markdown]
# Now evaluate the corrected reconstruction with the same measure.

# %%
rpCorrected = calcError(pf, recCor, 'RP')
rpCorrected

# %% [markdown]
# The uncorrected RP values range from 0.0088 to 0.0109, compared with 0.0246 to 0.0264
# after correction. This is neither surprising nor a defect. Ghost correction adds an
# assumption about the uniform portion, and that assumption can only cost fit. Judged on
# the pole figures alone, the uncorrected reconstruction wins.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Compare the reconstructions with the truth
#
# A measured texture has no known true ODF. This synthetic example does, so
# [calcError](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcError.html) can compare the functions directly. First compute the
# L1 error without correction.

# %%
l1Uncorrected = calcError(rec, odf, 'L1')
l1Uncorrected

# %% [markdown]
# Then compute the same error with correction.

# %%
l1Corrected = calcError(recCor, odf, 'L1')
l1Corrected

# %% [markdown]
# Here the uncorrected result loses by a factor of 23.2: 0.1255 against 0.0054. This is
# the argument for ghost correction in two pairs of numbers. The reconstruction that fits
# the pole figures roughly two to three times better is more than twenty times farther
# from the true ODF.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inspect the ODF sections
#
# Without ghost correction:

# %%
plot(rec, 'sigma', sections=9, verbose=False)

# %% [markdown]
# The component is broad and weak, and the surrounding density is raised. Now plot the
# corrected reconstruction on the same type of sections.

# %%
plot(recCor, 'sigma', sections=9, verbose=False)

# %% [markdown]
# The corrected sections concentrate more density at the component and return the
# surrounding background towards its true level.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Read a profile through the component
#
# A fibre is the one-dimensional set of orientations that maps a crystal direction onto a
# specimen direction. The following fibre passes through the model component. Plot the
# true ODF first.

# The uncorrected curve has three defects. Its peak reaches 25.23 mrd where the true peak
# reaches 39.78 mrd. At 45 degrees it is 2.82 mrd instead of 0.90 mrd, so the density
# missing from the peak has entered the background. Small bumps at 90 and 270 degrees are
# components conjured out of nothing.
#
# The dashed corrected curve follows the true curve closely. Its peak is 37.38 mrd and its
# value at 45 degrees is 1.06 mrd. The two extra bumps in the uncorrected curve are the
# ghosts that give the effect its name.

# ## Inspect the harmonic coefficients

# The effect lives in the odd-order coefficients, where it is clearest. First express all

# A systematic odd-even zig-zag is the diagnostic to look for. It shows that the
# reconstruction had to guess odd-order information that the pole figures did not
# measure. The pattern diagnoses this inversion ambiguity; it is not by itself evidence
# that every feature in a measured ODF is correct after correction.

#
# `plot(odf, f)` draws the ODF along the fibre, as MATLAB does; the profile values are
# `odf.eval(ori)` with `orientation(f, points=361)`, and the columns at 45, 90 and 270
# degrees are the entries 45, 90 and 270 counted from zero. MATLAB's `FourierODF(odf, 25)`
# is `SO3FunHarmonic(odf, bandwidth=25)`.
