# # Smoothing Three-Dimensional Grain Boundaries
#
# Grains reconstructed from voxel data have a boundary that follows the voxel faces. Every
# face normal points along one of the three axes, so a boundary normal distribution or a
# curvature computed from it measures the grid, not the specimen. This page coarsens the
# voxel surface, smooths it, and measures the price in grain volume. The aim is a surface
# suitable for quantitative analysis, not simply a smoother-looking picture.

# ## The boundary network is stratified
#
# A boundary face separates two grains. Along a triple line three grains meet, at a
# quadruple point four. `nodeType` counts the grains at every vertex and adds 10 on the
# outer hull of the measured volume, where a vertex inside a single grain also occurs.
# These are counts of mesh vertices, so they depend on resolution; they are not counts of
# complete triple lines or physical quadruple points.

# A junction must not be averaged with the interior of a face, which is why the smoothing
# below treats each stratum in turn.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Coarsen first
#
# `reduceBoundary` merges the vertices of each cell of twice the voxel size into one.
# Clustering distinguishes the grains meeting at a vertex and the faces of the hull,
# preserving their junction structure where the coarsened mesh remains resolved. The
# centroid of a cluster already averages the voxel steps; the flag `quadric=True` puts the
# vertex where the faces around it are best approximated instead, which keeps flat
# boundaries flat.

# Check how many faces remain and whether very small grains have lost their enclosing
# surface. Coarsening can collapse a grain below its cell size; this matters when the
# fine-grain population is part of the question.

# ## Smooth
#
# `smoothBoundary` moves the vertices and nothing else. Quadruple points and the hull stay
# fixed, every triple line is smoothed as a curve between its quadruple points, and every
# boundary face as a surface between its triple lines. The filters are the ones of the
# two-dimensional [grain smoothing](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainSmoothing_py.html): `laplaceFilter` shrinks each grain
# a little per iteration, `taubinFilter` keeps the volumes approximately, `curvatureFilter`
# solves for a smoothing length in one step.

# Triple lines remain shared by the same grains, but their vertices may move. Add
# `fixTripleLines=True` to hold them fixed during smoothing. Keeping the outer hull fixed
# conserves the enclosed total volume for a valid mesh; it does not conserve each grain's
# volume.
#
# Compare Laplace and Taubin smoothing from the same coarsened mesh. Include the coarsened
# result separately so its contribution is visible.

# The option `maxDisplacement` limits each coordinate change relative to the mesh entering
# the smoothing step. It does not undo displacement or a collapsed grain from coarsening.
# For example, half the smallest voxel spacing gives a bound tied to measurement
# resolution:
#
#     grainsBounded = smoothBoundary(grainsC, taubinFilter(20),
#                                    maxDisplacement=0.5 * min(ebsd.dx, ebsd.dy, ebsd.dz))
#
# The scheme `scheme='coupled'` smooths all movable vertices together instead of treating
# triple lines before face interiors. Compare its geometric effect if junction positions
# are central to the analysis.

# ## What the smoothing changes downstream
#
# The boundary normal distribution of the voxel surface has all its weight on the three
# axes. After smoothing the normals spread over the sphere.

# %%
gB = grains.boundary
gB = gB[np.all(gB.grainId > 0, axis=1)]
plot(calcGBND(gB), 'upper')

# %%
gBS = grainsS.boundary
gBS = gBS[np.all(gBS.grainId > 0, axis=1)]
plot(calcGBND(gBS), 'upper')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Refine
#
# `refineBoundary` splits every edge at its midpoint and every face into four. No vertex
# moves, so volumes, areas and the grains a face separates are inherited exactly.
# Refinement increases mesh density, for instance before a filter with a short smoothing
# length. It adds no measurement information and cannot recover a feature removed by
# coarsening.

# %%
grainsR = refineBoundary(grainsS)
print([len(grainsS.boundary), len(grainsR.boundary)])

# %% [markdown]
# ## Choose the treatment for the quantity being measured
#
# Volume, area and normal distributions need different levels of geometric fidelity. The
# area change below complements the volume comparison: a small change in volume can
# accompany a large decrease in staircase area.

# %%
surfaceArea = np.array([grains.surface().sum(), grainsC.surface().sum(), grainsL.surface().sum(), grainsS.surface().sum()])
print(100 * (surfaceArea / surfaceArea[0] - 1))

# %% [markdown]
# Here the sum counts shared interfaces twice, consistently for all four meshes. For a
# physical internal area per volume, count each interface once as on the
# [Boundary Network](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DBoundaries_py.html) page. Repeat the comparison with a smaller
# coarsening factor or fewer filter iterations: a conclusion about morphology should survive
# reasonable choices near the voxel resolution. A smooth mesh alone does not establish a
# resolved curvature or remove uncertainty from missing orientations.
