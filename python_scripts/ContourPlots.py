# # Contour Plots
#
# A contour line joins points with the same value. It lets a reader take a
# number from a figure instead of guessing it from a colour. Add contours
# when a value will be quoted in the text. Label them when more than one
# level matters.
#
# [Color Mapping](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ColorMaps_py.html) defines a contour level and explains why
# separate plots need the same explicit levels. This page shows how to draw,
# overlay, and label those levels. [Plot Types](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PlotTypes_py.html) compares
# contour plots with scatter and smooth plots.
#
# ## Start with a smooth spherical function
#
# The function used here has no physical meaning. It stands in for a pole
# figure, an inverse pole figure, a Schmid factor map, a Taylor factor map,
# or any other [function defined on the sphere](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SphericalFunctions.html).

# %% [markdown]
# The smooth colours make the face easy to recognize, and the colour bar
# gives the approximate values. They do not mark the exact positions where
# the function reaches an integer level.
#
# ## Choose filled bands or lines
#
# `contourf` replaces smooth shading by filled bands. Every value between
# two neighboring levels receives one colour. The bands are easy to scan,
# but they deliberately hide variation within each interval.

# %%
plot(sF, contourf=levels, upper=True)
mtexColorMap('blue2red')

# %% [markdown]
# The face is now quantized into one-unit bands from -4 to 5. Use
# `contour` instead when only the boundaries are needed. The explicit
# `levels` vector also makes this plot comparable with another figure using
# the same vector.
#
# ## Overlay contour lines on smooth colours
#
# Contour lines can be laid over a smooth plot instead of replacing it. This
# keeps the continuous colour variation while making exact levels visible.

hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The black curves outline the same integer bands without covering the
# smooth field. The red and blue regions remain visible between the lines.
#
# ## Label selected contours
#
# A single-axis contour plot returns a list holding one matplotlib contour set.
# It can be passed to matplotlib's `clabel` command. Label the levels needed for the
# reading instead of every line, because repeated labels quickly obscure the
# map.

# %%
levels2label = [-2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
plt.clabel(hContour[0], levels2label, fontsize=15)

# %% [markdown]
# The labels now make the sign and size of the main features readable. The
# unlabelled contours still show their shapes without adding more text.
#
# ## Label contours on several axes
#
# The same method applies to real pole figures. A multi-axis plotting command
# returns several contour handles, so there is no single handle to pass to
# `clabel`. `showText='on'` labels the drawn levels on every axis without
# requiring a loop over those handles.

# The two requested pole-figure entries expand under crystal symmetry to
# three plotted panels. Every panel carries the same levels from 1 to 15 in
# steps of 2, so the fields can be compared line by line. Explicit levels
# prevent each panel from choosing a different numerical scale.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB prints the contour handle `hContour`; a plot returns matplotlib's `ContourSet` in a
# list here, which the page does not print. The reconstructed ODF has 20040 centres where
# MATLAB's has 19848, since `calcODF` builds its SO(3) grid on its own (the pole figures
# agree line by line). Filled bands keep a discrete colour bar with MATLAB's colours.
