# # Merging Grains
#
# Grain segmentation correctly identifies a twin domain as a grain: it is a
# phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD measurements. For an analysis of
# the grain before twinning, however, that domain belongs to its host. Merging removes the
# selected internal boundaries and reconstructs this parent-grain footprint.
#
# In parent-phase reconstruction, merging is the second of two distinct steps. The child
# grains are first transformed to candidate parent orientations and only then merged where
# those candidates are compatible. See
# [Grain Graph Based Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainGraphBasedReconstruction_py.html) for that complete
# workflow.
#
# This page uses deformation twins in magnesium. It assumes familiarity with
# [grain reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html), [grain IDs](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html), and
# [boundary misorientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryMisorientations_py.html).

# morphology suggests twins, but morphology alone does not establish a twin relationship.

# ## Select candidate twin boundaries
#
# A twin law maps two pairs of crystallographic directions onto each other.
# `orientation.map` constructs that complete relationship. Comparing complete
# misorientations is more selective than comparing their rotation angles alone.

# The white traces follow the narrow lamellae. With this boundary sampling, 1406 of 2696
# magnesium-to-magnesium segments pass the five-degree test. A segment count is not a count
# of physical twins, and smoothing or resampling the same traces can change it. The
# tolerance is also an analyst choice: these are candidate twin boundaries, not proof of
# the mechanism or of which side is the parent.
# [Inferring Twin Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TwinningBoundaries_py.html) develops those limitations.

# ## Merging along selected boundaries
#
# `merge` joins the grains on both sides of every supplied boundary. It treats the
# selected boundaries as connections in a graph and merges each connected component. The
# operation is therefore transitive: if A is joined to B and B to C, all three become one
# grain. One false connecting boundary can consequently fuse a much larger parent than
# expected.

# The 91 segmented grains have become 28 merged grains. Black lines are the reconstructed

# internal to one merged grain.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Keeping track of the child grains
#
# `merge` writes `parentId` into the grains it was given, with one entry for every grain in
# `grains`. `parentId[k]` is the ID of the merged grain that contains `grains[k]`. This is
# the same kind of bookkeeping that `ebsd.grainId` provides between measurements and
# grains; it is a mapping of persistent IDs, not a list position.

# ## Which child domains are twins
#
# Merging establishes which domains belong together. It does not identify the original
# host or the twin. One simple rule works while twins occupy less area than their host:
# cluster each parent's child orientations and label the largest orientation cluster by
# area as the original grain.

# %%
# cache the child-grain areas
gArea = grains.area

# classify the smaller orientation clusters as twin domains
isTwin = np.ones(len(grains), dtype=bool)
for i in range(len(mergedGrains)):

  # find the children of this merged-grain ID
  parent = mergedGrains[i].id
  childInd = np.flatnonzero(parentId == parent)

  # cluster children with similar mean orientations
  fId, _ = calcCluster(grains.meanOrientation[childInd], maxAngle=15 * degree, method='hierarchical')

  # find the orientation cluster with the largest total area
  clusterArea = np.bincount(fId, gArea[childInd])
  fParent = np.argmax(clusterArea)
  isTwin[childInd[fId == fParent]] = False

# report the mapped-area fraction assigned to twins
twinAreaPercent = 100 * np.sum(grains[isTwin].area) / np.sum(grains.area)

# %% [markdown]
# The rule assigns 17 percent of the mapped area to twins. The red domains are lamellae
# inside the grey hosts, which is a useful spatial check on the classification. The rule
# fails if a twin consumes more than half of its host. This map alone cannot reveal that
# history.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Properties of the merged grains
#
# A merged grain receives a new shape and the summed pixel count. Other grain properties
# have no universal merge rule. In particular, directly averaging host and twin
# orientations usually does not recover the host orientation, so the mean orientation of a
# merged grain is not appropriate for this example. The intended physical quantity must
# determine how each property is carried from children to parents.
#
# For [grain orientation spread (GOS)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainOrientationParameters_py.html), `parentId`
# supplies the groups to `np.bincount`. An unweighted mean gives every child grain one
# vote.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# The two parent maps differ in both directions. The weighted value is larger in 14 of the
# 28 parents, by as much as 0.6 degrees. In those parents the larger children carry the
# higher GOS values, while small twins pull the unweighted mean down. More generally,
# orientation spread can depend on grain size, so the weighting rule must be reported.

# ## Pointing EBSD measurements at the merged grains

# grain therefore selects the wrong measurements without raising an error.

# ## Technical details
#
# `merge` returns the merged grains and writes `parentId` into the grains it was given,
# where MATLAB returns it as a second output. MATLAB's `accumarray` over the parent ids is
# `np.bincount` with weights, and the grain id written into a subset of a map goes through
# a mask on the whole map, since `ebsd['indexed']` is a copy.
