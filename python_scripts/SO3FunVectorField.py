# # Vector Fields in Orientation Space
#
# A vector field on the rotation group assigns a tangent vector to every orientation.
# Evaluating an `SO3VectorField` at an orientation $R$ returns an `SO3TangentVector`
# attached to $R$.
#
# Read [The Tangent Space on the Rotation Group](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationTangentSpace_py.html) first for the
# definition of tangent vectors and their left and right representations. Vector fields
# model orientation-dependent spin in Taylor and Sachs calculations. The gradient of an
# orientation distribution function (ODF) is another important example.

# ## A first vector field: the gradient of an ODF
#
# Consider the model ODF for a quartz specimen known as the Dubna texture. The gradient
# points in the direction of the fastest local increase of the ODF, and its norm gives that
# rate of increase.

# The arrows point uphill towards the nearest local maximum. Their lengths increase where the
# ODF changes more steeply. This ascent direction is the basis of the
# [steepest-descent algorithm](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.steepestDescent.html) used by [max](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.max.html)
# and [calcComponents](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcComponents.html).
#
# ## Three representations
#
# MTEX provides three interchangeable representations. A harmonic or RBF field stores three
# scalar component functions using the array convention introduced in
# [Vector-Valued Orientation Functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunVectorValued_py.html).
#
# | representation | class | when to use it |
# |---|---|---|
# | three harmonic component functions | [SO3VectorFieldHarmonic](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorFieldHarmonic.SO3VectorFieldHarmonic.html) | differentiation and global spectral approximation |
# | three radial-basis component functions | [SO3VectorFieldRBF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorFieldRBF.SO3VectorFieldRBF.html) | approximation by local kernels |
# | an evaluation formula | [SO3VectorFieldHandle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorFieldHandle.SO3VectorFieldHandle.html) | an explicit rule that can be evaluated at any orientation |
#
# All three representations support the common `SO3VectorField` operations.
#
# ## Left and right tangent-vector coordinates
#
# An `SO3VectorField` has a requested tangent-space representation and two associated
# symmetries. Left coordinates are the default. The [right](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorField.right.html) and
# [left](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorField.left.html) methods re-express the same geometric vectors; they do
# not change the vectors or their base orientations.

# %% [markdown]
# The small residual shows that converting the field before evaluation and converting the
# evaluated tangent vector give the same result. Arithmetic also converts compatible fields
# to a common representation automatically.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## Why the visible symmetries change
#
# A field's tangent vectors live in the frame of one side: left vectors in the specimen
# frame, right vectors in the crystal frame. Symmetry acts differently on the two coordinate
# choices. For a right-represented tangent vector, evaluations at symmetry-equivalent
# orientations are meaningful only with respect to the left symmetry. For a left-represented
# tangent vector, the reverse applies.

# %%
ori = orientation.rand(G.CS, G.SS, rng=rng)
G.eval(ori.symmetrise())

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
GR.eval(ori.symmetrise())

# %% [markdown]
# The left vectors turn with the crystal symmetry operation that relates the equivalent
# orientations, while the right vectors, given in crystal coordinates, repeat. The field
# keeps the crystal and specimen frames of the ODF either way, and the component functions
# of each side carry the symmetry that side leaves them.
#
# ## Operations on vector fields
#
# The following operations apply to vector fields `VF`, `VF1` and `VF2`:
#
# * sums, differences, scaling and division
# * inner products with [dot(VF1, VF2)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorField.dot.html)
# * cross products with [cross(VF1, VF2)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorField.cross.html)
# * norms with [norm(VF)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorField.norm.html)
# * normalization with [normalize(VF)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorField.normalize.html)
# * rotation with [rotate(VF, rot)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorField.rotate.html)
# * averages with [mean(VF)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorField.mean.html)
#
# Since a gradient is itself a vector field, MTEX can also compute its divergence, curl and
# scalar antiderivative.
#
# ## Divergence and the Laplacian
#
# Treating `G` as an orientation-space velocity field gives an intuitive reading of its
# divergence. Negative divergence marks a sink where nearby orientations condense. Positive
# divergence marks a source where they spread apart.
#
# The divergence of a gradient equals the Laplacian of its scalar field. Plot the two
# calculations side by side at the same sigma section.

# %% [markdown]
# The source and sink regions, contour shapes and colour scale agree in the two panels. The
# left panel was computed from the vector field, whereas the right panel was computed
# directly from the ODF.
#
# ## Curl and conservative fields
#
# Curl describes the axis of local circulation within orientation space. The curl of a
# gradient is zero, so the next plot should contain no nonzero arrows.

# %%
plot(G.curl(), 'sigma')

# %% [markdown]
# Vanishing curl identifies a conservative field: a field that is the gradient of a scalar
# potential. The [antiderivative](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3VectorField.antiderivative.html) method reconstructs
# that potential.

# %%
odf2 = G.antiderivative()

# %% [markdown]
# A gradient loses the additive constant of its source function. Restoring the original
# mean makes the reconstructed potential coincide with `odf`.

# ## Application: orientation-dependent spin in the Taylor model

# Taylor theory accommodates a prescribed strain by activating slip systems in each crystal.
# The antisymmetric part of the resulting deformation describes the local lattice spin, and
# therefore the local misorientation predicted for each orientation. Without an input
# orientation, [calcTaylor](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/strainTensor.calcTaylor.html) returns this spin as an

# ## Technical Details
#
# A field in the port keeps its crystal and specimen frames on either side; MATLAB's hidden
# symmetries are the groups the component functions carry. A field is stored on the side it
# is given in, so `right(G)` is a field of its own at bandwidth 49 where MATLAB keeps the
# left one at 48 and converts on evaluation. The Taylor spin field is in left components, as
# the Julia port keeps it, where MATLAB shows the right spin tensor: the copper spin
# $(0, -0.463, 0)$ in specimen coordinates stands for MATLAB's tensor with entries
# $\pm 0.3215$ in crystal coordinates, a vector of length 0.455. `dot(W, Miller(1, 0, 0, cs))`
# of the left field takes its right components, since a crystal direction lives in the
# crystal frame. The largest spin is found at $(259^\circ, 42.4^\circ, 123^\circ)$ with 1.207,
# MATLAB's at $(268.7^\circ, 45.4^\circ, 63.3^\circ)$, where the port's field has 1.173, 9.4
# degrees away under the symmetry of the strain. MATLAB's cached Dubna ODF keeps the
# plotting convention y↓→x of an earlier session, the port's follows the page's y↑→x, so
# the sigma sections of the gradient are MATLAB's turned by 180 degrees about z. The sampled
# orientation and the random coefficients come from NumPy.
