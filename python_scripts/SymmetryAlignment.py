# # Changing Crystal-Axis Settings
#
# A crystal-axis setting assigns the names $\vec a$, $\vec b$ and $\vec c$ to physical
# lattice vectors. A *crystal frame* is the Cartesian reference frame glued to that
# labelled lattice basis. It is distinct from the point group attached to it and from the
# plotting convention used to draw it.
#
# This page assumes the direct and reciprocal axes introduced in
# [Miller Indices](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalDirections_py.html). Read
# [The Crystal Reference System](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalReferenceSystem_py.html) first if the Cartesian
# embedding of a non-orthogonal lattice is new to you.
#
# Two kinds of convention occur in published data. One source may keep the same lattice
# labels but embed them in a different Cartesian crystal frame. Another may rename or
# permute the lattice axes themselves. Both change numerical coordinates, so both require
# an explicit frame change in MTEX.

# ## Read the Crystal Frame from the Summary
#
# [crystalFrame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/crystalFrame.crystalFrame.html) stores the point group, lattice metric
# and crystal frame together. Its printed summary is therefore the first place to check a
# convention. For this monoclinic example, MTEX uses $\vec x\parallel\vec a^*$ and
# $\vec z\parallel\vec c$ by default.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('12/m1', [4, 5, 6], np.array([90, 100, 90]) * degree, mineral='example')
cs

# %% [markdown]
# The summary reports `X||a*, Y||b, Z||c`. The direct axis $\vec a$ is $10^\circ$ from
# $\vec x$, while the reciprocal axis $\vec a^*$ is parallel to it. The `symmetry=False`
# option asks for these geometric angles without replacing either direction by a
# symmetry-equivalent one.

# %%
axisAngles = np.array([angle(cs.aAxis, vector3d.X, symmetry=False), angle(cs.aAxisRec, vector3d.X, symmetry=False)]) / degree
axisAngles

# %% [markdown]
# A different Cartesian embedding is requested by naming the parallel axes in the
# constructor.

# %%
csAlternative = crystalFrame('12/m1', [4, 5, 6], np.array([90, 100, 90]) * degree, 'X||a', mineral='example')
csAlternative

# %% [markdown]
# The second summary reports `X||a, Y||b, Z||c*`. The point group and lattice metric have
# not changed, but Miller indices, Euler angles and tensor components now refer to a
# different crystal frame. This is the embedding convention developed on
# [the preceding page](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalReferenceSystem_py.html).

# ## A Published Axis Permutation
#
# A separate problem arises when two sources assign the labels $\vec a$, $\vec b$ and
# $\vec c$ to different physical lattice vectors. The bundled data file contains the
# room-pressure stiffness tensor of San Carlos olivine measured by Abramson et al. (1997).
# Its source setting has lattice lengths $a=4.7646$, $b=10.2296$ and $c=5.9942$, with
# tensor axes $X_1\parallel[100]$ and $X_3\parallel[001]$.

# %%
csSource = crystalFrame('mmm', [4.7646, 10.2296, 5.9942], mineral='Olivine')
fname = mtexdatafile('olivine1997')
C = stiffnessTensor.load(fname, csSource)

# The printed Voigt matrix is useful here because its components are the quantities that
# a frame change must rewrite. The plot below shows the
# [directional magnitude](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/tensor.directionalMagnitude.html) $C_{ijkl}n_i n_j n_k n_l$.
# It is a compact view of the component permutation, not Young's modulus or a complete
# elastic response.

# Suppose the target convention cyclically renames the axes: old $\vec b$ becomes new
# $\vec a$, old $\vec c$ becomes new $\vec b$, and old $\vec a$ becomes new $\vec c$. The
# reordered lattice lengths state that mapping.

# ## Change the Frame, Do Not Rotate the Tensor
#
# A *frame change* re-expresses the same physical object in another reference frame. It
# does not move the object. For a tensor,
# [transformReferenceFrame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/tensor.transformReferenceFrame.html) applies the required
# basis change to every component and attaches the target crystal frame.

# In the left panel, the red maximum is labelled $[100]$. In the right panel, the same
# feature is labelled $[001]$ because old $\vec a$ is new $\vec c$. The feature has not
# rotated in the material; only its coordinates and crystallographic label have changed.
#
# The directional value along that physical axis is unchanged. The source direction
# $[100]$ and the target direction $[001]$ both give 320.5 GPa.

# ## Avoid Three Common Mistakes
#
# Do not attach `csTarget` to the unmodified component matrix. That would describe a
# different physical tensor. Use [rotate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/tensor.rotate.html) only when the material
# property itself moves; use `transformReferenceFrame` when only its coordinates change.
#
# Do not infer an axis mapping by sorting lattice lengths. Record the old and new basis
# relation from the data source, including axis signs and handedness. Some point groups
# also have setting-specific symbols, such as `2mm`, `m2m` and `mm2`; see
# [Crystal Symmetries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalSymmetries_py.html).
#
# Finally, a plotting convention only lays a reference frame out on screen. Changing it
# cannot repair a wrong crystal frame. When importing a tensor, also record its units and
# compact-matrix convention; the complete audit is developed in
# [Importing Tensor Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TensorImport_py.html). Orientations use the analogous
# [transformReferenceFrame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.transformReferenceFrame.html) method.
