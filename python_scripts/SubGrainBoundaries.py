# # Subgrain Boundaries
#
# A grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels produced by
# segmentation. A *subgrain boundary* lies inside such a grain. A *low-angle boundary* is
# instead defined by its misorientation angle. The two ideas usually overlap, but they are
# not synonyms.
#
# Low-angle boundaries can be described as arrays of dislocations. Their energy and
# structure change with misorientation until the dislocation cores begin to overlap. The
# conventional transition to high-angle boundaries lies between about 5 and 15 degrees,
# depending on the material. Above it, the energy depends less strongly on angle apart
# from [special orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CSLBoundaries_py.html) with lower energy.
#
# Deformation stores dislocations inside grains. During recovery, some of them organize
# into walls that divide a grain into subgrains. This page shows how MTEX records, draws,
# and measures those walls.
#
# The page assumes that the EBSD map has already been segmented in principle. See
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) for that step.
# [Grain Boundary Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryProperties_py.html) introduces boundary segments and
# connected components. See [Misorientations at Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryMisorientations_py.html)
# for the distinction between crystal-frame and specimen-frame axes.

# ## Reconstruct grains and their internal boundaries
#
# A single segmentation threshold has to choose between grain scale and subgrain scale. At
# 10 degrees the low-angle walls are missed. At 1 degree the same walls divide the map
# into many separate grains.
#
# [calcGrains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcGrains.html) accepts both thresholds at once. The first value
# separates grains, while the second records boundaries whose two pixels remain in the
# same grain as `innerBoundary`.

# %%
highAngle = 10 * degree
lowAngle = 1 * degree
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=[highAngle, lowAngle], minPixel=5)

# remove the pixel staircase before measuring boundary lengths
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 5)

# %% [markdown]
# ## What `innerBoundary` means
#
# An inner boundary is a topological result, not a second angle filter. MTEX marks a pixel
# pair as a boundary and then reconstructs connected grains. Two pixels can remain in the
# same grain through another path even when their direct misorientation exceeds the
# high-angle threshold.
#
# The strict low-angle selection therefore applies the angle criterion explicitly. The
# printed table keeps the distinction visible.

# %%

isLowAngle = innerAngle <= highAngle
subGB = grains.innerBoundary[isLowAngle]

# ## Draw the subgrain-boundary network
#
# The table reports 15,738 boundary segments between grains and 31,037 inner boundary
# segments. Of the latter, 30,577 satisfy the strict low-angle selection and 460 exceed 10
# degrees for the topological reason above. Default boundary smoothing simplifies and
# resamples the network, so these are post-smoothing segment counts rather than physical
# lengths.
#
# Drawing the inner boundaries with a transparency that follows their misorientation
# angle keeps the strongest walls visible and lets the weakest fade out.
#
# Compute the IPF colours explicitly so that the map does not print an unrelated
# automatic-colour-key message.

# Black lines separate grains. Blue lines are the strictly selected low-angle boundaries
# within them. Strong walls cross some grain interiors, while other grains contain almost
# none. The contrast may reflect heterogeneous deformation, but short isolated lines may
# also be noise.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Normalize the amount within each grain
#
# [subBoundarySize](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.subBoundarySize.html) counts inner-boundary segments belonging
# to each grain. Its optional logical selection keeps only the strict low-angle
# population. Dividing by the number of pixels removes most of the effect of grain size
# within this one map.

# %% [markdown]
# Grains crossed by many blue walls have the largest segment-per-pixel values. This ratio
# is useful within one regular grid, but it changes with pixel spacing and should not be
# compared between acquisitions.
#
# The physical-unit alternative uses [subBoundaryLength](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.subBoundaryLength.html).
# Dividing the selected length by [area](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.area.html) gives boundary length per
# area, here in inverse micrometres.

# %% [markdown]
# The length-density map singles out the same grains as the count-density map. The two
# measures are nearly proportional on this regular grid. Length per area is the quantity
# to report because it has physical units. It removes the direct segment-count
# dependence, but detection still depends on step size, angular precision, thresholds, and
# smoothing.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Misorientation axes of the low-angle boundaries
#
# The misorientation axis describes the rotation across a wall. Its relation to the
# boundary plane distinguishes tilt, twist, and mixed character. It is not generally the
# line direction of every dislocation in the wall.
#
# The density estimate below is weighted by segment length, so resampling a long wall into
# more segments does not give it extra influence. A 5 degree kernel smooths the discrete
# axes into a distribution.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# The colour scale spans about 0.83 to 1.20 multiples of random distribution (mrd), where
# 1 is uniform. This ferrite analysis therefore resolves no strong preferred crystal-frame
# rotation axis. Compare the two clear maxima in the forsterite example of
# [Tilt and Twist Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TiltAndTwistBoundaries_py.html). That page also computes the
# axes in specimen coordinates and compares them with traces.
#
# A nearly uniform result is not proof that the physical axes are random. Most boundaries
# here are only a few degrees across, where small EBSD orientation errors can cause large
# axis errors. Interpret low-angle axes as a population and check the acquisition
# precision.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Networks and isolated segments
#
# A wall crossing a grain and a few isolated segments above 1 degree have different
# physical meanings. `componentSize` gives each segment the number of segments in its
# connected group. Here a dataset-specific cutoff of 50 segments separates larger networks
# from shorter features.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# Blue marks continuous structures, often running across a grain and meeting its boundary
# at both ends. Red marks short components. Many are likely orientation noise crossing the
# 1 degree threshold, although a short component is not proof of noise.
#
# The strict selection puts 29.1 percent of its segments in components above 50. Counting
# every inner boundary gives 30.8 percent, or about the 31 percent obtained without the
# explicit angle filter. Both populations are counted by the density maps above, and that
# is worth remembering before reading much into a small difference between two grains. The
# 50-segment cutoff itself changes with resampling and step size, so choose it again for a
# new map.

#
# `calcGrains` writes the grain of every measurement into the map it was given, so
# MATLAB's `[grains, ebsd] = calcGrains(ebsd, ...)` is one assignment here. MATLAB's
