# # Quadruple Points
#
# A *junction* is a boundary vertex where the number of meeting grain boundary segments is
# not two. On a square measurement grid, four pixels meet at every interior vertex. A
# checkerboard arrangement of two labels can therefore create a junction with four
# boundary segments - a *quadruple point*.
#
# The ambiguity is diagonal connectivity. Connecting one pair of like pixels separates the
# other pair, while connecting the other pair reverses that decision. The resulting grain
# count can depend on which diagonal is chosen because a grain is a spatially connected
# region.
#
# Exact four-way contacts in a two-dimensional physical network are usually unstable and
# split into three-segment junctions. The grid contact on this page is instead a
# digital-topology ambiguity introduced by sampling. In three dimensions, a physical
# quadruple point has a different meaning.
#
# The `removeQuadruplePoints` option to [calcGrains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcGrains.html) resolves this
# ambiguity during reconstruction. This page assumes the reconstruction concepts
# introduced in [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html).

# the identity-oriented interior and exterior as separate grains, so the map contains
# three grains rather than two.

# interior and exterior connected; the ring pixels were already connected to each other
# elsewhere. The expected two grains remain.

# The interior outline has joined the exterior network, while the boundary segments and
# their total length are unchanged. Only their connectivity at the critical vertex
# differs.
#
# The option replaces the four-segment vertex with two coincident three-segment junctions.
# In this two-grain example they are not strict *triple points*, because a triple point
# must separate three distinct real grains. See [Triple Points](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TriplePoints_py.html) for
# that distinction.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Separate the coincident junctions for display
#
# The two replacement junctions initially have identical coordinates.
# [smoothBoundary](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.smoothBoundary.html) normally fixes every junction. Its
# `moveTriplePoints` option releases every interior junction, despite the narrower name,
# and lets the two points move apart.
#
# A [taubinFilter](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/taubinFilter.html) suppresses the pixel staircase while limiting the
# systematic area loss of Laplacian smoothing.

# The coincident contact has opened into a narrow neck. Smoothing has moved the geometry

# Signed [curvature](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grainBoundary.curvature.html) makes the opened pinch visible as
# neighbouring bends in opposite directions.

# %% [markdown]
# The blue and red extrema beside the pinch have opposite signs. The sign depends on the
# stored walk direction, so use [Boundary Curvature](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryCurvature_py.html) before
# interpreting it as convex or concave relative to a particular grain.

# ## Technical Details
#
# `EBSDsquare(rotations, phaseId, CSList)` builds a map on a square grid from an array of
# rotations, MATLAB's constructor of the same name; the rows of the array are the rows of
# pixels. An array of identities is written as `rotation.byEuler` of three arrays, where
# MATLAB has `rotation.id(size)`.
#
# MATLAB numbers the ring grain 1 and the surrounding grain 2, the port the other way
# round, so the curvature is drawn for `grains[1]` where MATLAB writes `grains(1)`. The
# smaller id is the first side of a segment in both, so MATLAB walks the ring with the ring
# on its left and the port with the surrounding grain on its left, and the signs, the
# colours of the figure, are reversed. The inverse pole figure key of the triclinic frame colours the two orientations
# grey and purple where MATLAB colours them red and mint.
