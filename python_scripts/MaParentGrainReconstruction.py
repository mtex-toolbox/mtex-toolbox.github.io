# # Martensite Parent Grain Reconstruction
#
# This page reconstructs prior austenite grains from a martensite EBSD map. It continues the
# workflow introduced in [Parent Beta Phase Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TiBetaReconstruction_py.html). Here
# the orientation relationship (OR) must first be fitted to the steel.
#
# The worked sequence has four stages: fit the OR, choose parent variants, merge compatible
# grains, and transfer the result back to the pixel map.

# ## Segment the measured martensite

# A grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels produced by
# segmentation. A 3-degree threshold separates the child grains. Grains with fewer than two
# pixels are removed during segmentation.

# The orientation colours form groups inside larger, former austenite regions. The black lines

# ## Set up the reconstruction job
#
# A [`parentGrainReconstructor`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.parentGrainReconstructor.html)

# grain maps to a recovered parent.

# %% [markdown]
# The constructor guesses the parent and child phases from their populations. Supply an OR as
# the third constructor argument if that guess is wrong. In this fully transformed sample, we
# instead set the phase symmetries by assigning an initial parent-to-child OR after
# construction.

# The displayed summary reports parent and child grain counts, their areas, and the fraction

# misfit. For the initial Kurdjumov-Sachs (KS) guess these are 2.51, 3.49, 4.41, and 5.35
# degrees, as printed below.
#
# ## Fit the parent-to-child orientation relationship
#
# A real austenite-to-martensite transformation does not follow one ideal OR exactly. The OR
# should therefore be fitted for each sample.
# [`calcParent2Child`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcParent2Child.html) implements the
# iterative method proposed by Nyyssönen and co-workers. It starts from the KS guess and fits
# the child-to-child misorientations.

# The fitted OR is 2.5 degrees from the ideal Nishiyama-Wassermann OR. Its first misfit

#
# The earlier version of this page said that `calcParent2Child` stored these values in

# [`calcGBFit`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcGBFit.html) to recompute them. The fit assumes
# that most measured boundaries are child-to-child boundaries.
#
# ## Map the boundary misfit
#
# `calcGBFit` returns one fit for every child-grain neighbour pair.
# [`selectByGrainId`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grainBoundary.selectByGrainId.html) selects all boundary segments
# belonging to those pairs.

# Transparency converts the angular fit to a boundary diagnostic. Opaque segments have larger
# misfit, while faint segments better match the fitted OR. Spatial clusters of opaque segments
# deserve scrutiny before the reconstruction parameters are relaxed.
#
# ## Build the variant graph
#
# A *variant* is one crystallographically equivalent child orientation predicted from a
# single parent orientation through the known OR. A *variant graph* has one node per
# child-grain and candidate-variant pair. Edges connect compatible candidates belonging to
# neighbouring grains.
#
# [`calcVariantGraph`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcVariantGraph.html) converts angular misfit
# into an edge weight. The `threshold` is the misfit whose weight is one half. The `tolerance`
# controls the width of the transition from high to low weight. Earlier text called
# `tolerance` a Gaussian standard deviation, but the implementation uses it directly as the
# transition-width parameter.

# %%
job.calcVariantGraph(threshold=3.5 * degree, tol=3.5 * degree)
job

# %% [markdown]
# Earlier versions also passed `'tortuosity'` here. `calcVariantGraph` has no such option, so
# MATLAB silently ignored it. The graph above uses only the documented threshold and tolerance
# options.
#
# Large maps can reduce the first graph by grouping similarly oriented variants, then separate
# them in a second pass:
#
# ```python
# job.calcVariantGraph(threshold=2.5 * degree, tol=2.5 * degree, mergeSimilar=True)
# job.clusterVariantGraph()
# job.calcVariantGraph(threshold=2.5 * degree, tol=2.5 * degree)
# ```
#
# This two-pass route trades variant resolution in the first graph for lower cost. The present
# map is small enough to retain every variant immediately.
#
# ## Cluster candidate variants
#
# [`clusterVariantGraph`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.clusterVariantGraph.html) propagates
# compatibility through the graph. The `includeSimilar` option lets candidates within 5
# degrees share support.

# %%
job.clusterVariantGraph(includeSimilar=True)
job

# %% [markdown]
# The result is the table `job.votes`. Row `i` of `job.votes.prob` ranks the candidate
# probabilities for grain `i`. The matching entries in `job.votes.parentId` identify those
# candidates. The first column is the best-supported candidate.

# %%

mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# Large uniform values mark grains with a clear parent assignment. Values near 0.5 indicate at
# least two similarly plausible parents. Such ambiguity often occurs when the candidates are
# related by twinning.
#
# ## Transform the confident child grains
#
# *Transform* is the first parent grain reconstruction step. Each selected child grain
# receives one candidate parent orientation and changes from the child phase to the parent
# phase. Here only best candidates with probability above 0.5 are accepted.

# %%

# The map contains transformed parent fragments rather than final parent grain footprints. The
# strict vote transforms 10,581 child grains, leaving 64 child grains that occupy 0.59% of the
# indexed area. A manual alternative is
# [`selectInteractive`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.selectInteractive.html):
#
# ```python
# job.selectInteractive()
# ```
#
# It lets a reader click a grain and choose among its candidate parents. It is not executed
# here because a published page must run without clicks.
#
# ## Reconsider uncertain grains from their neighbours
#
# A second variant-graph pass with relaxed probabilities is one route. Here
# [`calcGBVotes`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcGBVotes.html) instead asks the already
# reconstructed neighbours to vote for potential parents. `reconsiderAll` also permits an
# earlier assignment to be replaced.

# Earlier versions passed `'tortuosity'` to `calcGBVotes` as well. That function also has no
# such option, so it had no effect. The new parent fragments fill much of the space left by
# the strict vote. It leaves 48 child grains, occupying 0.088% of the indexed area.
#
# ## Merge compatible parent fragments
#
# *Merge* is the second parent grain reconstruction step. Neighbouring transformed grains with
# compatible parent orientations are combined into one parent-grain footprint.
# [`mergeSimilar`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.mergeSimilar.html) uses a 7.5-degree threshold
# here.

# %% [markdown]
# The similarly coloured fragments have coalesced into larger parent grains. Small enclosed
# child grains still interrupt some of those footprints.
#
# ## Merge small inclusions
#
# An inclusion is a grain entirely enclosed by another grain. Some poorly indexed child grains
# remain as inclusions because no parent orientation could be assigned confidently.
# [`mergeInclusions`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.mergeInclusions.html) merges inclusions of at
# most 50 pixels into the surrounding parent grain.

# %%
job.mergeInclusions(maxSize=50)

plot(job.parentGrains, job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)

# %% [markdown]
# The large parent-grain shapes remain, while small enclosed fragments no longer break them
# up. This operation changes topology rather than choosing another parent variant.
#
# ## Identify variants and packets
#
# Once the parent orientations are known, [`calcVariants`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcVariants.html)
# classifies each transformed child grain. `variantId` is its finest crystallographic class. A
# *packet* groups variants that share the parent {111} habit plane. In this reconstruction,
# `packetId` selects the parent {111} plane closest to the martensite (011) plane.
