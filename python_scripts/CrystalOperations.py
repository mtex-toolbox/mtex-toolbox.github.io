# # Operations on Crystal Directions and Planes
#
# A [Miller](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Miller.html) represents either a direct-lattice vector $[uvw]$ or a
# reciprocal-lattice normal $(hkl)$ in a crystal frame. It supports ordinary vector
# geometry, but comparisons have one extra input: crystal symmetry.
#
# By default, `angle`, `dot` and `eq` compare a vector with the symmetry orbit of the
# other vector. In contrast, constructions such as `cross` act on the indexed vectors
# actually supplied. This page shows when to keep the default and when to request
# `symmetry=False`.
#
# Read [Miller Indices](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalDirections_py.html) and
# [Lattice Metric and Plane Geometry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/LatticeMetric_py.html) first if direct and reciprocal
# indices are new. [Crystal Symmetries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalSymmetries_py.html) introduces the point
# groups used here, while [Axes and Antipodal Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorsAxes_py.html) explains when
# opposite vectors represent the same axis.

# ## A Kikuchi Pattern as a Geometric Map
#
# A simulated spherical Kikuchi pattern of quartz makes the operations visible. This is a
# master pattern on the sphere, not a raw planar detector image. The left plot shows the
# pattern, and the right plot shows its
# [spherical Radon transform](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunHarmonic.radon.html).
#
# A band centre is a great circle on the pattern. The transform maps that great circle to
# the point representing its plane normal.

# %%

# ## Symmetrically Equivalent Planes and Directions
#
# A *symmetry orbit* contains the vectors obtained by applying every operation of the
# crystal point group. Its members are symmetrically equivalent because the crystal
# cannot distinguish the corresponding settings.
#
# The family of directions equivalent to $[uvw]$ is written $\langle uvw\rangle$. The
# family of planes equivalent to $(hkl)$ is written $\{hkl\}$.
# [symmetrise](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.symmetrise.html) lists the orbit as directed vectors.

# %%
symmetrise(r)

# %% [markdown]
# Quartz point group `321` has six operations, and none repeats this normal. The output
# therefore contains six directed normals. For this rhombohedron they form three opposite
# pairs.
#
# A geometric plane is unchanged when its normal is reversed. Thus the six directed
# normals describe three distinct plane axes. Adding the symmetry orbits to the plots
# accounts for the corresponding bands.

# %%
hold(True)

circle(r.symmetrise(), parent=ax1, color='red')
circle(z.symmetrise(), parent=ax1, color='yellow')

plot(m, **opt, markerEdgeColor='lightBlue', symmetrised=True)
plot(r, **opt, markerEdgeColor='red', symmetrised=True)
plot(z, **opt, markerEdgeColor='yellow', symmetrised=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The option `symmetrised` on `plot` performs the same expansion. A plain `symmetrise`
# call keeps one entry per symmetry operation and may contain repeated vectors. Use
# `unique` when the number of distinct members is the question.

# %%
directedNormalCount = len(symmetrise(r, unique=True, antipodal=False))
directedNormalCount

# %% [markdown]
# The first count keeps opposite normals distinct. The `antipodal` option instead treats
# a vector and its negative as the same axis.

# %%
planeAxisCount = len(symmetrise(r, unique=True, antipodal=True))
planeAxisCount

# %% [markdown]
# The two outputs are 6 directed normals and 3 plane axes. Point-group equivalence and
# antipodal equivalence are separate choices; select the one that matches the physical
# object being described.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Multiplicity
#
# The [multiplicity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.multiplicity.html) is the number of distinct directed
# vectors in a symmetry orbit. It is the count returned by
# `symmetrise(..., unique=True, antipodal=False)`. A direction on a symmetry axis has
# lower multiplicity because some operations leave it fixed.
#
# For diffraction with Friedel equivalence, opposite reflection normals contribute
# together. Using a Laue group includes that equivalence in the conventional multiplicity
# factor for a powder reflection.

# %%
csCubic = crystalFrame('m-3m')
hCubic = Miller([[1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]], csCubic)

# %%
multiplicity(hCubic)

# %% [markdown]
# The cubic $\{100\}$, $\{110\}$ and $\{111\}$ forms have multiplicities 6, 12 and 8. The
# order of the indices does not determine this count; the stabilising symmetry of the
# direction does.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Are Two Normals Equivalent?
#
# The two objects below are opposite directed normals. The operator `==` asks whether
# point group `321` maps one normal onto the other.

# %%
r1 = Miller(1, 1, -2, 0, cs, 'hkil')
r2 = Miller(-1, -1, 2, 0, cs, 'hkil')

# %%
r1 == r2

# %% [markdown]
# The result is false because no operation of `321` makes that mapping. Treating the
# normals as axes makes their signs irrelevant.

# %%
isclose(r1, r2, antipodal=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The second result is true. This distinction matters whenever directed crystal vectors,
# plane axes and Friedel-equivalent reflections appear in the same calculation.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Does a Direction Lie in a Plane?
#
# A direction $[uvw]$ lies in a plane $(hkl)$ when their scalar product is zero. In
# three-index notation this is the *zone law*
#
# $$hu+kv+lw=0.$$
#
# Incidence concerns the two indices that were written. Use `symmetry=False` so that `dot`
# does not substitute a symmetry-equivalent vector.

# %%
csOrtho = crystalFrame('mmm', [4, 5, 6])
plane = Miller(1, 1, 0, csOrtho, 'hkl')
directionInPlane = Miller(1, -1, 0, csOrtho, 'uvw')

# %%
dot(plane, directionInPlane, symmetry=False)

# %% [markdown]
# Zero confirms that $[1\bar{1}0]$ lies in $(110)$. In contrast, the result for $[100]$
# is 1, so that direction does not lie in the plane.

# %%
dot(plane, Miller(1, 0, 0, csOrtho, 'uvw'), symmetry=False)

# %% [markdown]
# This Cartesian dot-product test also works with four-index trigonal and hexagonal
# notation. There is no need to translate the indices manually.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Zone Axes and Spanned Planes
#
# Two lattice planes intersect along a lattice direction called a *zone axis*. Its
# direction is the cross product of their reciprocal normals.

# %%
d1 = round(cross(m, r))
d1

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
plot(d1, marker='s', parent=ax1, markerFaceColor='lightgreen', labeled=True, backgroundColor='w')
circle(d1, parent=ax2, lineColor='lightgreen')

# %% [markdown]
# The output uses `UVTW` because a cross product of two reciprocal normals is a
# direct-lattice direction. [round](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.round.html) rescales it to small integer
# indices.
#
# The green square lies where the two corresponding bands cross in the pattern. In the
# Radon plot, its green great circle passes through their two normal points.

# %%
d2 = Miller(-2, 0, 1, cs, 'uvw')
d2

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
plot(d2, marker='s', parent=ax1, markerFaceColor='orange', labeled=True, backgroundColor='w')
circle(d2, parent=ax2, lineColor='orange')

# %% [markdown]
# Conversely, two direct-lattice directions span a plane. Their cross product is
# displayed in reciprocal `hkil` notation.

# %%
n = round(cross(d1, d2))
n

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
circle(n, parent=ax1, lineColor='white')
plot(n, **opt, markerEdgeColor='white')

# %% [markdown]
# The white band contains `d1` and `d2` in the pattern. In the Radon plot, the white
# normal lies where the green and orange great circles intersect.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Symmetry-Reduced and Geometric Angles
#
# By default, [angle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.angle.html) returns the smallest angle between the first
# vector and the symmetry orbit of the second. The result is independent of which
# equivalent index triplet was supplied.

# %%
symmetryAngle = angle(r1, r2) / degree
symmetryAngle

# %% [markdown]
# The point-group-reduced angle is $60^\circ$. If the normals represent plane axes,
# include antipodal equivalence as well.

# %%
axisAngle = angle(r1, r2, antipodal=True) / degree
axisAngle

# %% [markdown]
# The result is numerically close to zero. To compare only the two Cartesian vectors as
# written, ignore crystal symmetry.

# %%
geometricAngle = angle(r1, r2, symmetry=False) / degree
geometricAngle

# %% [markdown]
# The geometric angle is $180^\circ$ because the normals are exactly opposite. Thus the
# same two index sets give a $60^\circ$ point-group angle, a near-zero plane-axis angle
# and a $180^\circ$ geometric angle.
#
# The option `symmetry=False` is available to many commands that accept crystal directions or
# orientations. Use it when the indexed vectors themselves, rather than their symmetry
# classes, are the subject.

# %% [markdown]
# ## From the Crystal Frame into the Specimen Frame
#
# An [orientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationDefinition_py.html) states how a crystal is placed in the
# specimen. It maps a direction from the Cartesian crystal frame into the specimen frame.

# %%
ori = orientation.byEuler(10 * degree, 20 * degree, 30 * degree, 'Bunge', cs)

plt.close('all')
plot(ori * pattern, resolution=0.25 * degree, complete=True, upper=True)
mtexColorMap('black2white')

# %% [markdown]
# The whole pattern has moved rigidly with the crystal. Multiplying the zone axis by the
# same orientation returns a specimen direction rather than a `Miller` object.

# %%
specimenDirection = ori * d1
specimenDirection

# %% [markdown]

# %%
hold(True)
plot(specimenDirection, marker='s', markerFaceColor='lightgreen', label=d1.char(family=False), backgroundColor='w')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Applying the orientation to the full symmetry orbit marks every specimen direction in
# which this crystal family points.

# %%
hold(True)
plot(ori * d1.symmetrise(), marker='s', markerFaceColor='lightgreen', label=d1.char(family=False), backgroundColor='w')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# That set is the [pole figure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationPoleFigure_py.html) of this one orientation for
# the family represented by `d1`.

# ## Cartesian Components Without Crystal Metadata
#
# Building a [vector3d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.vector3d.html) from the Cartesian components of a
# `Miller` drops the crystal symmetry and crystal frame. The result is *frame-free*: it
# has an empty frame and resolves against the session default when it is rendered.

# %%
cartesianDirection = vector3d(d1.x, d1.y, d1.z)
cartesianDirection

# %% [markdown]
# The frame name shown in the display is therefore the current session default, not a
# frame stored by the vector. The empty stored frame confirms that distinction.

# %%
isFrameFree = cartesianDirection.frame is None
isFrameFree

# %% [markdown]
# The result is true. This cast is not a frame change; it removes the information needed
# to interpret the components as lattice indices. A true frame change re-expresses the
# same physical object in a named frame and leaves the object itself untouched.
#
# The ordinary spherical coordinates remain available: the polar angle from +Z and the
# azimuth from +X, in degrees.

# ## Technical Details
#
# The quartz master pattern is MATLAB's `quartzPattern.mat`, a v7.3 object file the
# frameSymmetry branch of MATLAB itself no longer loads; the sample data set
# `quartzPattern` reads its harmonic coefficients with h5py into the quartz frame, so the
# figures of this page have no MATLAB counterpart. `vector3d(m)` keeps the crystal frame
# here, the frame-free vector is built from the components. MATLAB's `polar(d1)` without
# an output prints the two angles in degrees; here they are the properties `theta` and
# `rho`.
