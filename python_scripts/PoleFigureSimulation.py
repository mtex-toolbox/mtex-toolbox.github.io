# # Simulating Pole Figure Data
#
# With measured data the true orientation distribution function (ODF) is unknown. A
# reconstruction can therefore be judged by how well it reproduces the measurement, but
# that is also the data it was fitted to. Simulation removes this circularity. Start from
# a known ODF, compute the pole figures it would produce, add counting noise, reconstruct,
# and compare the result with the known model.
#
# This page runs that controlled experiment once. It then asks a practical question: how
# many pole figures does this particular reconstruction need? The model components are
# introduced in [ODF Modelling](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFModeling_py.html), the forward projection in
# [Pole Figures of an ODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFPoleFigure_py.html), and the inverse problem in
# [ODF Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html).
#
# A plotting convention states how a reference frame is laid out on screen. Here specimen
# Y points up and specimen X points right; the convention does not rotate the specimen or
# the ODF.

# ## A known test ODF
#
# The orthorhombic model contains six components. Half of the volume is uniform, three
# fibre components contribute 0.05 each, and two unimodal components contribute 0.05 and
# 0.30. The large uniform portion makes the inversion deliberately difficult because
# independently scaled pole figures constrain that portion least.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('orthorhombic')
mod1 = orientation.byAxisAngle(xvector, 45 * degree, cs)
mod2 = orientation.byAxisAngle(yvector, 65 * degree, cs)
model_odf = 0.5 * uniformODF(cs) + \
  0.05 * fibreODF(Miller(1, 0, 0, cs), xvector, halfwidth=10 * degree) + \
  0.05 * fibreODF(Miller(0, 1, 0, cs), yvector, halfwidth=10 * degree) + \
  0.05 * fibreODF(Miller(0, 0, 1, cs), zvector, halfwidth=10 * degree) + \
  0.05 * unimodalODF(mod1, halfwidth=15 * degree) + \
  0.3 * unimodalODF(mod2, halfwidth=25 * degree)

# %% [markdown]
# The sigma sections separate the compact maxima of the two unimodal components from the
# extended bands of the three fibres. The uniform half of the model is the common baseline
# beneath those features rather than a separate peak.

# ## Simulating the measurement
#
# Three choices determine the simulated measurement: which lattice planes are measured,
# which specimen directions are sampled, and how many counts are expected. Superposition
# coefficients may also be supplied when diffraction peaks from several lattice planes
# overlap.
#
# The seven lattice directions below are kept in a deliberate order. The final experiment
# adds their pole figures from left to right.

# %%
h = Miller([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]], cs)

# %% [markdown]
# They are sampled on a [regular grid](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/regularS2Grid.html) with 5 degree spacing.

# %%
r = regularS2Grid(resolution=5 * degree)

# %% [markdown]
# [calcPoleFigure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcPoleFigure.html) evaluates the ODF for every lattice
# direction and specimen direction. Its printed summary confirms the seven pole figures
# and their sampling grids.

# %%
pf = calcPoleFigure(model_odf, h, r)

# ## Adding counting noise
#
# The values above are exact pole densities. A diffraction measurement counts quanta, so
# its counting error is commonly modelled by a Poisson distribution. At a point with pole
# density $P_h(r)$, the call below draws a count with mean $1000 P_h(r)$. Thus 1000 is an
# intensity scale, not the same mean count at every point. No background is added in this
# example.
#
# [noisepf](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.noisepf.html) makes the absolute fluctuations larger at bright
# points but their relative size smaller.

# %%
pf = noisepf(pf, 1000)

plot(pf)

# %% [markdown]
# The seven panels retain the smooth bands and maxima imposed by the model, but
# individual grid values now fluctuate. The fluctuations are most conspicuous relative to
# the signal in the darker parts of each panel.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reconstructing and comparing
#
# The simulated counts can be passed to the ordinary reconstruction. The scale of each
# pole figure is estimated as part of that inversion.

# %%
odf = calcODF(pf)

plot(odf, 'sigma', sections=6, verbose=False, minmax=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Compared with the model sections above, the compact maxima and fibre bands are in the
# same places and have similar shapes. The minimum and maximum labels expose differences
# in amplitude that independent colour scales could hide.
#
# [calcError](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcError.html) compares the two normalized ODFs on a 5 degree
# orientation grid. Its default ODF-to-ODF measure is the L1 distance divided by two,
# which is the minimum volume fraction that would have to be moved to turn one
# distribution into the other.

# %%
modelError = calcError(odf, model_odf, resolution=5 * degree)
print(f'L1 reconstruction error: {modelError:.4f}')

# %% [markdown]
# The error is 8.3 percent of the volume. A real experiment has no known model ODF against
# which this number can be computed, which is the reason for simulating.

# %% [markdown]
# ## How many pole figures are needed
#
# Each additional pole figure supplies more equations to an underdetermined inverse
# problem. The error may therefore fall as figures are added, then level off once the
# remaining ambiguity is not resolved by these data. Noise and regularisation mean that
# the decrease need not be monotonic.
#
# The following experiment reconstructs from the first pole figure, the first two, and so
# on. Each subset is reconstructed both without and with
# [ghost correction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFGhostCorrection_py.html).

# Both curves fall steeply from one pole figure to four: the error with ghost correction
# drops from 0.299 to 0.110. They then flatten, with a bump when the fifth pole figure is
# added. In this experiment, four pole figures capture most of the recoverable
# information, and which four are chosen matters more than simply increasing their
# number.
#
# The corrected curve is lower at every count, though not by much: 0.083 against 0.102 at
# seven pole figures, and almost no difference at one. Ghost correction addresses a
# specific defect by estimating the uniform portion. This model has a large uniform
# portion by construction; see [The Ghost Effect](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFAmbiguity_py.html) for why
# it is difficult to recover.
#
# Four is not a general minimum. The result depends on this ODF, crystal symmetry, ordered
# set of lattice directions, full sampling grid, count scale, and reconstruction settings.
# The bump at five is a useful warning: the solver fits noisy pole figures, not the hidden
# model used to score it.

# %% [markdown]
# ## What this simulation leaves out
#
# This controlled example isolates counting noise and the ambiguity of the inversion.
# Real pole figures may also have incomplete angular coverage, background, defocusing,
# uncertain normalization, outliers, and overlapping diffraction peaks. Simulation tests
# the reconstruction under the effects included in the model; it does not validate
# corrections that were omitted.

# ## Technical Details
#
# The slice `pf[:i + 1]` is MATLAB's `pf({1:i})`. The Poisson draw of `noisepf` is not
# seeded, as MATLAB's is not, so the errors of the table vary in the third digit between
# builds. MATLAB's `table` is a printed loop.
