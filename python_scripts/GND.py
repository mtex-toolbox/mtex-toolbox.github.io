# # Geometrically Necessary Dislocations
#
# A spatial change in lattice orientation requires dislocations to preserve
# compatibility. These are *geometrically necessary dislocations* (GNDs).
# Conventional two-dimensional EBSD measures only the in-plane orientation
# gradient, so it cannot identify a unique three-dimensional dislocation
# population.
#
# The workflow on this page follows Pantleon (2008). It computes the measured
# lattice curvature and fits the least-energy combination of candidate
# dislocation systems that reproduces it. Read
# [Dislocation Systems](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DislocationSystems_py.html) first for the Burgers vector,
# line vector, tensor basis, and relative line-energy weights used here.

# The example is a ferritic steel map after two percent uniaxial deformation.
# The `minPixel` option marks indexed regions smaller than six pixels as
# `notIndexed` during segmentation. A 2.5 degree threshold separates the
# remaining grains.

# ## Denoise before differentiating
#
# Differentiation amplifies point-to-point orientation noise and therefore
# overestimates GND density. An axis-angle color key makes local departures
# from each grain's mean orientation easier to see before filtering.

# The pixel-scale color speckle is the symptom to notice. A
# `halfQuadraticFilter` reduces that noise while the `fill` option uses the
# grain partition to prevent smoothing across grain boundaries.

# The denoised map retains broad color gradients inside grains but suppresses
# much of the isolated pixel-to-pixel variation. Filtering is therefore part
# of the measurement model, not merely cosmetic preparation for the plot.

# ## Estimate GND content in one command
#
# Ferrite is body-centred cubic, so this example uses the standard BCC set of
# 48 edge and 4 screw systems. Following the normalization on the preceding
# page, the edge weight is one and the screw weight is $1-\nu$, with
# Poisson's ratio $\nu=0.3$.
#
# There is no universally accepted set of line-energy weights. Replace these
# illustrative values with values appropriate to the material and model.

# [`calcGND`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcGND.html) returns an energy-weighted GND density for
# each pixel and the signed density assigned to each candidate system.
# The first output is often called the total dislocation energy. With the
# dimensionless weights above, it is an energy-weighted density rather than
# an absolute energy measurement.

# Read the map on its logarithmic scale. Bright regions require a larger

#
# The curvature tensor $\boldsymbol\kappa$ collects directional derivatives
# of lattice orientation. A two-dimensional map supplies derivatives along
# its two in-plane directions but not along the map normal.

# ## Convert curvature to the Nye tensor
#
# Nye's dislocation-density tensor $\boldsymbol\alpha$ is related to
# curvature by
#
# $$ \boldsymbol\alpha = \boldsymbol\kappa^{T}
#    - \mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol\kappa)\,\mathbf I. $$
#
# The method [`dislocationDensity`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/curvatureTensor.dislocationDensity.html)
# applies this relation.

# This tensor remains incomplete because the map contains no derivative
# normal to its plane. MTEX can recover the $(3,3)$ entry from the two known
# diagonal curvature components, but the other missing entries remain `NaN`.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Rotate the candidate systems
#
# Each tensor supplied by `dS.tensor` is the rank-two dyad
# $\mathbf b\otimes\hat{\mathbf l}$. Its length unit is inherited from the
# unit cell, usually Angstrom and displayed as `au`.
#
# The tensors are initially expressed in the crystal frame. The measured
# curvature is expressed in the specimen frame, so each pixel orientation
# must rotate all candidate systems into that same frame; MATLAB's outer
# product `ebsd.orientations * dS` is a column of orientations times a row of
# systems.

# ## Fit individual system densities
#
# [`fitDislocationSystems`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/curvatureTensor.fitDislocationSystems.html)
# solves a linear program at every pixel. It reproduces the six measured
# curvature components while minimizing
# $\sum_j u_j\lvert\rho_j\rvert$ over the candidate systems.
#
# The port solves the programs with its own simplex, all pixels in parallel,
# where MATLAB needs the Optimization Toolbox function `linprog`. The result
# `rho` has one row per EBSD pixel and one column per dislocation system. Its
# signs distinguish the two line senses represented internally during the fit.

# The scale factor converts the density coefficients from
# $1/(\mathrm{\mu m}\,\mathrm{au})$ to $1/\mathrm{m}^2$. With micrometre scan
# units and Angstrom lattice units it is $10^{16}$.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reconstruct the fitted tensors
#
# Sum each rotated basis tensor multiplied by its fitted density. The numeric
# matrix `rhoWorked` does not retain units, so the tensor unit must be restored
# explicitly after this manual reconstruction.
