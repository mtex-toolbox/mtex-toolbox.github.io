# # Advanced Low-Level Parent Grain Reconstruction
#
# This page reconstructs prior austenite from a martensite EBSD map by constructing
# similarity matrices directly. It compares two sources of evidence while holding the data
# and fitted orientation relationship (OR) fixed.
#
# The first matrix scores pairs of neighbouring child grains. The second scores all three
# child grains meeting at a triple point. The preceding
# [Low-Level Parent Phase Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/LowLevelParentGrainReconstruction_py.html) explains the
# manual parent-candidate and grain-ID operations reused here.

# ## Fit the parent-to-child orientation relationship
#
# [Parent Austenite Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MaParentGrainReconstruction_py.html) explains why the OR must
# be fitted for each sample. It also introduces the iterative method of Nyyssönen and
# co-workers. Here the ideal Kurdjumov-Sachs (KS) OR is the initial parent-to-child guess.

# The fit uses a two-column matrix of neighbouring child orientations. Excluding notIndexed
# grains keeps both columns in the martensite phase. Pairs below 5 degrees are removed because
# they provide little information about distinct transformation variants.

# is:
#
# ```python
# filledEBSD = boundaryParentEBSD['indexed']
# filledGrains = calcGrains(filledEBSD, angle=3 * degree, minPixel=10)
# filledGrains = smoothBoundary(filledGrains, 20)
# F = halfQuadraticFilter()

# hold(True)
# plot(filledGrains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
# hold(False)
# ```
#
# The outlines constrain the fill, so interpolation does not cross the reconstructed
# boundaries. The filter fills missing and newly removed small-grain sites. Earlier text
# promised to fill all not reconstructed pixels, but larger indexed bcc regions are not missing
# and remain bcc.
#
# ## Boundary-graph thresholds
#
# * Initial child-grain segmentation: 3 degrees and at least five pixels. The earlier page
#   parameter was two pixels; lowering `minPixel` restores that finer, more expensive child
#   partition.
# * Neighbour-pair prefilter: at least 5 degrees.
# * Boundary similarity: 2-degree threshold and 1.5-degree tolerance.
# * Boundary graph inflation power: 1.6.
# * Accepted parent-component fit: below 5 degrees and at least two children.
# * Similar-parent merge: below 4 degrees.
#
# ## Reconstruct footprints from triple points
#
# Boundary evidence can be misleading when child variants from different parents happen to
# match a theoretical child-to-child misorientation. A triple point tests three distinct child
# grains against one common parent, providing a stronger local constraint.
# [Triple-Point-Based Parent Phase Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TriplePointBasedReconstruction_py.html)

# ## Technical Details
#
# Two things separate the numbers here from the text. The port's `calcParent2Child` reaches a
# lower misfit basin (first quintile 1.22 against 1.48 degrees), and every count after the fit
# follows the fitted relationship. And the segmentation with `removeQuadruplePoints` gives
# 4,467 grains and 11,233 retained pairs where MATLAB has 4,443 and 11,290, a difference of the
# quadruple point removal rather than of this page, which the Markov clustering amplifies: with
# MATLAB's fitted relationship set by hand the page gives 725 boundary components against 707,
# 361 accepted against 360, and the triple-point fits and similarities to three digits
# (2.646, 3.227, 4.013 degrees for the first three quintiles).
