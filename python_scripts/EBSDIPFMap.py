# # Inverse Pole Figure Color Coding of Orientation Maps
#
# An orientation has three parameters and a colour has three numbers, so turning one
# into the other looks easy. It is not. Orientation space is curved and has crystal
# symmetry, whereas RGB colour space is a flat box. No map between them is
# simultaneously smooth, one to one, and free of arbitrary choices.
#
# An *inverse pole figure colour key* is the usual compromise. It fixes one specimen
# direction and colours the crystal direction parallel to it. This page develops that
# construction, shows how to read the resulting map, and compares the keys used by MTEX
# and commercial EBSD systems.
#
# The example assumes that the data has been [imported](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDImport_py.html) and its
# [reference frame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) has been checked. The basic map call is
# introduced in [Plotting EBSD Maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDPlotting_py.html). Inverse pole figures themselves
# are explained in [Inverse Pole Figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationInversePoleFigure_py.html).

# ## From a crystal to a colour
#
# Start with the crystal itself. Olivine grows with a characteristic habitus, which MTEX
# represents as a `crystalShape`.

# %%
cS = crystalShape.olivine()

plot(cS, colored=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Opposite faces belong to the same symmetry-related face family. They therefore share
# one categorical colour. This plot is an analogy, not yet an IPF key: the colours
# distinguish faces but do not vary within a face.
#
# The next plot places that shape in the measured mean orientation of each large grain.
# A *grain* is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD measurements
# produced by segmentation. The reconstruction and boundary smoothing are explained in
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html).

# %%
# reconstruct the grains and attach their ids to the map
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, minPixel=5)

# smooth the pixel staircase of the grain boundaries
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 10)

# draw the boundaries and add crystals only to large grains
plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=1.5, micronbar=False)
bigGrains = grains[grains.numPixel > 150]

hold(True)
plot(bigGrains['olivine'], 0.8 * cS, lineWidth=2, colored=True)

# Seventy odd grains are large enough to carry a crystal. Their different face
# directions make the orientation changes across the map visible. The idea of the
# colour key is to take the colour of the face that points towards you. A crystal shape
# has only six of them, so only six colours would ever appear. A continuous key replaces
# the faceted crystal by a ball whose surface colour varies continuously.
#
# MATLAB draws that ball with `plot(ipfKey, '3d')`, red, green, and blue anchoring
# specific crystal directions and the colours between them varying smoothly, and then
# places one sphere on each large grain, turned by the grain's mean orientation, so that
# the point facing the viewer shows the colour that grain gets. The three dimensional
# drawing of the key is not ported yet; the port goes straight from the key to the grain
# colours.

ipfKey = ipfHSVKey(ebsd['olivine'])

colors = ipfKey.orientation2color(bigGrains['olivine'].meanOrientation)
plot(bigGrains['olivine'], colors)

# %% [markdown]
# The grain colours are the colours of the centres of those spheres. The geometry has
# disappeared, but the selected crystal direction has been retained as colour.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading the map
#
# Flattening the coloured sphere into a stereographic projection turns it into the
# legend for the map.

# %%
plot(ipfKey, complete=True, upper=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The option `complete` draws the whole upper hemisphere, with $[001]$ in the centre,
# $[100]$ at both ends of the horizontal, and $[010]$ at top and bottom. Orthorhombic
# symmetry makes the four quadrants repeat the same colours mirrored, so one quadrant
# already carries every colour the key can produce. That quadrant is the fundamental
# sector, which holds one symmetry-equivalent representative of every crystal direction,
# and the key normally plots only it.
#
# For this olivine setting, red means that the crystal $c$ axis is parallel to the
# specimen normal. Green represents the $a$ axis and blue the $b$ axis. Intermediate
# directions receive intermediate colours.
#
# The same information can be plotted in the inverse pole figure itself. Each grain is
# placed at the crystal direction parallel to the normal, and marker area is scaled by
# grain area.

# %%
plotIPF(bigGrains['olivine'].meanOrientation, colors, vector3d.Z, markerSize=0.05 * bigGrains['olivine'].area, markerEdgeColor='k')

# %% [markdown]
# The markers cover the sector rather than clustering in one corner. These large grains
# therefore have no single strongly preferred crystal axis along the specimen normal.
# Two markers stand out by size: the red one in the $[001]$ corner, 6 degrees from the
# $c$ axis, and the pale magenta one in the interior, 53 degrees from it. Their grain
# areas are within one percent of each other, so the two largest grains of this map sit
# at quite different crystal directions.
#
# An IPF map does not retain a complete orientation. It records where one specimen
# direction falls in the crystal frame and discards the remaining rotation about that
# direction. Equal colours therefore do not prove that two orientations are equal.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Choosing the reference direction
#
# Nothing forces the fixed direction to be the specimen normal. It may be a rolling
# direction, a foliation, or the axis of a cylindrical specimen. The property that stores
# this choice is `ipfDirection`.

# %%
# colour the map by the specimen x direction
ipfKey.ipfDirection = vector3d.X
colors = ipfKey.orientation2color(ebsd['olivine'].orientations)
plot(ebsd['olivine'], colors)

# %% [markdown]
# The microstructure is unchanged, but the colours are completely different. Before
# comparing two IPF maps, check that they use the same phase symmetry, specimen reference
# direction, and colour-key algorithm. Also check the specimen reference frame: an
# incorrect frame produces a plausible map with incorrect colours.
#
# The `ipfDirection` may also be a list with one direction per measurement. This is
# useful for a curved specimen, where the local surface normal changes across the map.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Customizing the color key
#
# Colour placement within the sector is conventional. It can be moved without changing
# which crystal directions the key distinguishes. In MATLAB, `ipfKey.colorPostRotation`
# takes a reflection or a rotation of the colour space: reflecting it interchanges green
# and blue, so the sector keeps its shape and its white centre while its green and blue
# corners exchange places, and rotating it by 120° cycles red, green, and blue. Only the
# colour assignment moves; the crystal symmetry, reference direction, and orientations do
# not change. The post rotation of the colour space is not ported yet.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Laue or enantiomorphic symmetry groups
#
# The example began by assigning the olivine phase its Laue group, `mmm`. This
# identifies crystal directions related by the improper operations in that group. A key
# can instead use the proper subgroup, `222`, whose operations are rotations only.
#
# EBSD systems report orientations as Euler angles, and Euler angles describe proper
# rotations. This does not mean that an EBSD pattern can never contain information about
# polarity. The symmetry used to index the pattern and the symmetry used to reduce
# directions for colouring are choices that must be stated separately.

# %%
# use only the proper rotations of the olivine point group
ipfKey = ipfHSVKey(ebsd['olivine'].CS.properGroup())
plot(ipfKey)

# %% [markdown]
# The `222` group has half as many operations as `mmm`. Its fundamental sector is
# therefore twice as large: half of the upper hemisphere rather than one quarter. The
# extra area distinguishes directions that the Laue key assigned the same colour.

# %%
colors = ipfKey.orientation2color(ebsd['olivine'].orientations)
plot(ebsd['olivine'], colors)

# %% [markdown]
# The proper-group map contains colour distinctions that the earlier Laue map
# suppressed. This is additional displayed information only if `222` is the symmetry
# intended for the analysis; it is not a sharper rendering of the same equivalence
# relation.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Other inverse pole figure keys
#
# Commercial EBSD systems use different colour assignments. MTEX provides TSL/OIM and HKL
# Channel 5 keys so that their maps can be reproduced. These two constructors use the
# Laue group of the supplied phase.

# %%
plot(ipfTSLKey(ebsd['olivine'].CS))

# %% [markdown]
# For orthorhombic olivine, the TSL key is difficult to distinguish from the default MTEX
# key. Its centre remains bright and the three crystal axes retain the familiar corner
# colours.

# %%
plot(ipfHKLKey(ebsd['olivine'].CS))

# %% [markdown]
# The HKL key blends the three corner colours directly. Its sector becomes dark in the
# middle, whereas the MTEX and TSL keys keep a bright centre.
#
# A more serious difference appears for symmetry groups whose sector cannot be mapped
# smoothly and one to one onto the colour box. A discontinuous key gives different
# colours to directions only a fraction of a degree apart. The resulting map can contain
# a colour edge that is not a grain boundary. MTEX prints a warning when such a key is
# constructed.

# %%
plot(ipfTSLKey(crystalFrame('-3m')), complete=True, upper=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The warning is intentional, but the drawn hemisphere looks perfectly smooth:
# neighbouring directions 0.05 degrees apart differ by at most 0.003 in RGB. The jump is
# not inside the disc, it is on its rim. Plot the other hemisphere and compare the two
# rims.

# %%
plot(ipfTSLKey(crystalFrame('-3m')), complete=True, lower=True)

# %% [markdown]
# At $[01\bar{1}0]$ the upper hemisphere ends in green and the lower one begins in blue,
# and over 91 percent of the rim the two sides differ by more than 0.1 in RGB. A crystal
# direction that lies almost in the specimen plane can therefore change colour completely
# under a fraction of a degree of measurement noise. The resulting colour edge in a map
# is a property of the key, not evidence of a physical boundary.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The maths behind an IPF colour
#
# Let the orientation $\mathbf{O}$ map crystal coordinates into specimen coordinates,
# and let $\mathbf{r}$ be the fixed specimen direction. The inverse pole figure direction
# in crystal coordinates is
#
# $$\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{O}^{-1}\mathbf{r}.$$
#
# Crystal symmetry maps $\mathbf{h}$ to one representative in the fundamental sector.
# The direction key then maps that representative to an RGB triplet. Because many
# orientations can produce the same $\mathbf{h}$, this construction cannot be one to one
# in orientation space.
