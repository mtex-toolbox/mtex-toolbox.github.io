# # Phase Transitions
#
# During a solid-state phase transition, new crystals do not appear at random orientations.
# The old lattice remains while the new one forms, so a low-energy change keeps as many
# atomic planes and directions aligned as possible. The result is the fixed angular relation
# between parent and child lattices developed in
# [Fitting the Orientation Relationship](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationRelationshipFit_py.html). The same OR
# applies wherever that transformation occurs.
#
# Symmetry turns that one relation into several possible child orientations. A parent
# lattice with 24 proper rotations can satisfy the same relation in distinct ways. These
# possibilities are the variants defined on the fitting page, and one parent grain commonly
# transforms into several variants at once.

# ferrite. The pole figure shows the child orientations that one parent orientation can
# produce.

# Notice the 24 variants produced from one parent orientation. Each contributes three
# symmetrically equivalent (001) poles, so the figure carries 72 pole positions. KS gives 24
# variants, whereas the Nishiyama-Wassermann relationship gives 12. A real steel may follow
# neither ideal relationship exactly. The measured data must determine which relationship
# and variants are present.
#
# ## Read the transformation backwards
#
# In many experiments only the child phase survives to be measured. Examples include
# martensite, ferrite, and alpha titanium. The former parent-grain structure may nevertheless
# control the material's properties, so the metallurgist wants to recover it.
#
# Parent grain reconstruction solves this inverse problem. Children from one parent are
# variants of a common parent orientation. Neighbouring child grains that are mutually
# consistent with the OR can therefore be traced back to one parent.
#
# The reconstruction has two steps that must remain distinct. First, each child grain is
# transformed individually to a candidate parent orientation. Second, neighbouring candidates
# with compatible parent orientations are merged into one parent-grain footprint.
#
# ![](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/figures/python/parent-reconstruction-workflow.svg)
#
# The middle panel keeps the child-grain footprints separate while their candidate parent
# orientations align. Only the final merge removes the internal boundaries and creates the
# reconstructed parent grain.
#
# A single child grain is compatible with several possible parents. Choosing among them
# requires evidence from neighbouring grains. Reconstruction methods are therefore graph
# problems rather than independent calculations for each grain.
#
# ## Relate variants, packets, and Bain groups
#
# A *packet* is a coarse grouping of variants that share the same habit plane. For KS-type
# martensite, this is the parent {111} plane to which a variant's child lattice aligns.
#
# A *Bain group* is a coarse grouping by Bain correspondence. It records which parent {001}
# cube-axis plane a variant's child lattice aligns to.
#
# Packet and Bain group are independent classifications of the same variants. A variant
# belongs to one packet and one Bain group, but neither grouping is a subdivision of the
# other.
#
# ## Follow the chapter
#
# Begin with [Parent and Child Variants](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ParentChildVariants_py.html) for the forward and
# inverse variant calculations. [Martensite Variants](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MartensiteVariants_py.html) then fits a
# measured OR and assigns variant, packet, and Bain group IDs.
#
# Two complete reconstructions follow. [Parent Beta Phase Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TiBetaReconstruction_py.html)
# treats titanium, and [Parent Austenite Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MaParentGrainReconstruction_py.html)
# treats steel. Start with the material system closest to your own.
#
# [Transformation Texture](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TransformationTexture_py.html) asks the forward question: given a
# parent texture and an OR, what child texture results?
#
# The remaining pages expose the reconstruction algorithms.
# [Grain Graph Based Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainGraphBasedReconstruction_py.html) uses grain-to-grain
# compatibility. [Triple Point Based Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TriplePointBasedReconstruction_py.html)
# uses the stronger constraint where three grains meet.
# [Low Level Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/LowLevelParentGrainReconstruction_py.html) and
# [Low Level Reconstruction 2](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MaParentGrainReconstructionAdvanced_py.html) show the individual
# steps for cases the automatic workflow handles poorly.
#
# The chapter ends with [Fitting the Orientation Relationship](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationRelationshipFit_py.html),
# which explains the fitting objective and its local and global solutions. In an applied
# reconstruction, fit the material's OR before committing parent variants; the worked
# reconstruction pages demonstrate that sequence first. A measured OR may differ from a
# textbook relation enough to change the reconstructed result visibly.
#
# ## Connect to the prerequisite chapters
#
# An OR is a [misorientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Misorientations.html) with the additional parent and child
# phase symmetries. Reconstructed grains use the segmentation model introduced in
# [Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains.html). Their measurements and maps come from
# [EBSD Analysis](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDAnalysis.html).
