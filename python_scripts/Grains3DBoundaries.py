# # The Three-Dimensional Boundary Network
#
# The boundary of a set of three-dimensional grains is one surface mesh for the whole
# volume. Every face separates two grains and, when the grains were reconstructed from
# voxels, knows the two voxels it separates. Along the edges where three grains meet run
# the triple lines, and where four grains meet sits a quadruple point. These contacts
# constrain grain growth and provide possible paths for intergranular transport or damage.
# This page measures how much interface is present and shows how the junctions connect it,
# using the IN100 volume of the reconstruction page.

# ## One face, two grains, two voxels
#
# A face is a triangle, two per voxel face. `grainId` holds the two grains it separates,
# with the face normal pointing from the first into the second. `ebsdId` holds the two
# voxels on either side, and `misorientation` the misorientation between their
# orientations, computed from the voxels rather than from the grain means. Faces on the
# outer hull of this voxel reconstruction have a zero in the second column of both. In a
# general imported mesh the zero can occur on either side, so test both columns.

# %%

# Count area, not triangles: refining a face changes its mesh count without adding any
# physical interface. The following fractions distinguish the measurement hull from
# contacts between indexed grains.

# ## Select faces
#
# A boundary is selected like a list: by the grains at its sides, by phase, or by any
# property of the faces. The faces of one grain, the faces between two grains, and the
# faces above a misorientation angle are three common selections.

#
# `edges` lists every edge once and tells for each face which three edges bound it. An edge
# on two faces lies inside a boundary face, an edge on three or more faces on a triple line.
# `nodeType` counts the grains at every vertex: 2 inside a face, 3 on a triple line, 4 at a
# quadruple point, and 10 more for a vertex on the outer hull.

# ## From faces to the boundary character
#
# Each face carries all five parameters of a grain boundary: the misorientation of the two
# grains and the normal of the face. The normals of the voxel surface point along the axes,
# so the surface has to be smoothed first, see [Smoothing](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DSmoothing_py.html), before
# the [boundary normal distribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryNormalDistribution_py.html) or the boundary
# character distribution reads anything but the voxel grid.

grainsS = smoothBoundary(reduceBoundary(grains, 2, quadric=True), taubinFilter(20))

# ## How much internal boundary is there per unit volume?
#
# Boundary area per specimen volume is a useful geometric input when comparing interfacial
# storage or transport between microstructures. Each shared face appears once in
# `grains.boundary`. Summing `grains.surface()` instead would count an internal interface
# twice and include the hull.

# %%
internal = np.all(grainsS.boundary.grainId > 0, axis=1)
internalArea = grainsS.boundary[internal].area.sum()
boundaryAreaDensity = internalArea / grainsS.volume.sum()
print(boundaryAreaDensity)

# %% [markdown]
# The unit is inverse length. This value uses all internal contacts and the full
# reconstructed volume. To report only indexed grain boundaries, use
# `grainsS.boundary['indexed']` and state the corresponding volume denominator.

# %% [markdown]
# ## What fraction of indexed boundary area has a low angle?
#
# Use a stated angle threshold and weight by face area. This describes the local
# misorientation stored on the reconstructed faces, rather than a count of low-angle grain
# pairs. After coarsening, the retained faces carry inherited misorientations; remeasure
# from the original data if local orientation gradients are the quantity of interest.

# %%
angleLimit = 15 * degree
lowAngle = gBS.misorientation.angle() < angleLimit
lowAngleAreaFraction = gBS[lowAngle].area.sum() / gBS.area.sum()
print(lowAngleAreaFraction)

# %% [markdown]
# A low-angle fraction alone does not establish a connected boundary path. Connectivity
# also requires the grain pairs and junction network. Likewise, the specimen-frame normal
# distribution above describes preferred interface inclinations, not preferred
# crystallographic planes. For one selected phase, `calcGBND(gBS, grainsS['phase name'])`
# transforms normals into the crystal frame; see
# [Boundary Normal Distribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryNormalDistribution_py.html).

# ## Technical details
#
# `calcGrains` alters the volume it is given (the grain ids stay on it), so MATLAB's
# `[grains, ebsd] = calcGrains(ebsd, ...)` is `grains = calcGrains(ebsd, ...)`. `edges` and
# `nodeType` are methods of the boundary and `accumarray` is `np.bincount`. The grain ids count
# from 1 as MATLAB's, 0 standing for the outside; `ebsdId` counts the voxels from 0 in the
# port's array order, -1 standing for the outside, as for every map of the port.
