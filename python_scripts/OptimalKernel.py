# # Optimal Kernel Selection
#
# [Density Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html) showed that kernel width decides which features
# survive smoothing. A width that is too small leaves oscillations and sharp peaks at
# individual observations. A width that is too large erases genuine features of the unknown
# density.
#
# There is no universally optimal halfwidth. The useful value depends on both the number of
# independent observations and the smoothness of the unknown density. This page compares the
# selection methods provided by [calcKernel](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.calcKernel.html) and shows how to
# check their choices against a known model.

# `reconstructionError` compares density values over orientation space. It is not an angular
# error and must not be labelled in degrees.
#
# ## Select from the error of the density
#
# Two further methods judge a candidate kernel by the error of the density it produces.
# `'UCV'` (unbiased cross-validation), the port's default, estimates the integrated squared
# error of every candidate from the harmonic coefficients of the sample and takes the
# halfwidth where it is least. `'conservative'` replaces the texture's harmonic energies by
# lower confidence bounds and ignores the harmonic degrees it cannot resolve; the halfwidth
# it returns is then at least as wide as the one of least error. Both are bounded below by a
# noise floor: no halfwidth so narrow that the sampling noise could raise bumps above a
# fifth of the estimate's maximum, with `noiseFloor=False` to switch it off. Both cost about one harmonic transform of the
# sample, under a second for a million orientations. They use their own random generator
# here, which splits the sample into the parts it compares.

# Both ask for 4.1 degrees against the 7.1 degrees of KLCV above, and their error, 0.131,
# lies below KLCV's 0.139. With 10000 orientations the harmonic energies of this texture are
# resolved well enough that the conservative bound and the unbiased estimate agree.
#
# ## What the methods use
#
# The method names are sometimes described as flags in older material. The current interface
# passes each name as the value of `method`.
#
# | method | information used | practical reading |
# |---|---|---|
# | `'KLCV'` | leave-one-out likelihood on candidate kernels | MATLAB's default; data-adaptive |
# | `'RuleOfThumb'` | nearest-neighbour resolution of the sample | quick scale estimate |
# | `'magicRule'` | sample size and crystal/specimen symmetry | conservative asymptotic rule |
# | `'UCV'` | unbiased estimate of the integrated squared error, with a noise floor | the port's default; aims at the best halfwidth |
# | `'conservative'` | lower bounds of the harmonic energies, a bound on the noise | errs towards smoothing |
#
# Older descriptions say that `'RuleOfThumb'` uses the variance of the orientations to
# estimate smoothness. The current implementation instead uses a quantile of
# nearest-neighbour angular distances, with a lower halfwidth limit of 2 degrees.
#
# KLCV evaluates how well kernels centred on the other orientations predict each omitted
# orientation. The `samplingSize` option limits how many observations contribute to that
# score. It reduces computation, but it does not create an independent validation dataset.
#
# ## Compare the methods on the same samples
#
# The full scaling experiment associated with this page uses 10, 100, ..., 1000000
# orientations. That run is appropriate for an attended benchmark, not an executable
# documentation page. Uncomment the alternative `sampleSize` line when that full study is
# intended.

# With 30 orientations the two new rules return nearly their widest candidates, 38 and 40
# degrees: the noise floor finds that nothing narrower would stand out of the sampling noise,
# and their error is the price of that caution. From 300 orientations on they agree, and at
# 1000 orientations they ask for 6.1 degrees where KLCV asks for 9.4, at nearly the same

# The curves compare density-space error, with smaller values indicating a closer
# reconstruction. Their differences show that kernel selection is part of the statistical
# model rather than a display preference.
#
# ## Before trusting an automatic halfwidth
#
# Automatic selection assumes that the input orientations represent the intended population.
# Neighbouring pixels in one EBSD grain are strongly correlated, so treating every pixel as
# independent can select a kernel that follows intragranular scatter. The orientations of a
# map therefore carry the mark `notIID`, and `calcKernel` refuses them. `'UCV'` and
# `'conservative'` accept them with the grain id of every pixel, `groups=ebsd.grainId`, or
# the map itself once its grains are computed; they then compare only parts of the sample
# that share no grain. Otherwise use grain means to select the kernel when grains are the
# independent sampling units.
#
# Weighting answers a separate question. After selecting a kernel from grain means, an
# area-based ODF may still use pixels or grain-area weights.
# [ODF Estimation from EBSD Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD2ODF_py.html) works through that choice.
#
# Also inspect the selected halfwidth and the reconstructed plots. A value at the edge of the
# tested candidate range, or peaks supported by only one or two observations, is a reason to
# test nearby kernels manually.
#
# ## The maths behind the sample-size rule
#
# For the de la Vallée Poussin kernel, `'magicRule'` sets the concentration parameter
# $\kappa$ proportional to $N^{2/7}$. The kernel halfwidth then behaves approximately as
#
# $$ \delta \mathrel{\sim} \kappa^{-1/2} \mathrel{\sim} N^{-1/7}. $$
#
# The rule therefore narrows the kernel as the sample grows. It cannot use the unknown
# density's feature sizes, which is why it is conservative. Rule-of-thumb and
# cross-validation methods use the observations to add information about those scales.
#
# ## The maths behind UCV and the conservative rule
#
# Write the density in harmonics orthonormal for the uniform distribution,
# $f = 1 + \sum_{\ell \ge 1} f_\ell$, with the degree energies $A_\ell = \|f_\ell\|^2$.
# A radial kernel multiplies degree $\ell$ by a factor $b_\ell$ that falls as the halfwidth
# grows. For $N$ independent orientations the mean integrated squared error is exactly
#
# $$ \mathrm{MISE} = \sum_{\ell \ge 1} (1 - b_\ell)^2 A_\ell + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\ell \ge 1}
#    b_\ell^2 \left( d_\ell - A_\ell \right), $$
#
# where $d_\ell$ is the dimension of degree $\ell$ reduced by the crystal and specimen
# symmetry. `'UCV'` inserts unbiased estimates of $A_\ell$, obtained from products of
# disjoint parts of the sample, and minimises over the candidates. `'conservative'`
# inserts lower confidence bounds and sets the unresolved high degrees to zero. Lowering
# the energies can only move the minimiser to a wider kernel, so the choice is at least the
# halfwidth of least error whenever the bounds hold. Splitting a map into parts that share
# no grain keeps the estimates unbiased when pixels of one grain are correlated.
#
# The noise floor looks at the estimate itself. At an orientation where the smoothed density
# is $y$, the estimate is a sum of $N$ independent terms, none larger than $\psi(0)/N$, with
# variance $y\,\|\psi\|^2/N$. Bennett's inequality bounds its deviation at every one of the
# independent kernel footprints of orientation space, and the floor is the smallest
# halfwidth at which that bound stays below a fifth of the estimate's maximum plus half the
# local density.
