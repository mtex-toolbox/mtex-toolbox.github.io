# # Exporting Grains
#
# A grain combines several kinds of information: an identity, scalar properties, a mean
# orientation, an outline, and a place in the boundary network. No single exchange format
# on this page preserves all of them. Choose the representation that the receiving
# program needs, and record the information required to interpret it.
#
# This page assumes that grains have already been reconstructed as in
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html). The examples use the Forsterite data
# set. Exporting a picture instead of the underlying data is covered in
# [Exporting Plots](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PlottingExport_py.html).

# ## Record how the grains were made
#
# The displayed summary identifies the phases and the number of grains that will be
# exported. The cutoff above and the 10 degree reconstruction threshold are also part of
# the result. Record them with the source map, the MTEX version, and any other processing
# choices.
#
# Smoothing changes polygon coordinates, areas, perimeters, and segment lengths. It does
# not change grain IDs, pixel counts, or mean orientations. We therefore keep `grainsRaw`
# for measurement-level boundary data and use a smoothed copy for shape data.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## Export a grain table
#
# A table collects one row per grain, here as a dictionary of columns that the `csv`
# module writes for a spreadsheet or a statistics package.
#
# A grain ID is a persistent label, not the row number in a subset. The distinction is
# demonstrated in [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html). The `phase` property is the
# numeric phase value imported with the map, so the readable mineral name is exported as a
# separate column. A grain with no data on one side of it has truncated geometry. The
# `isBoundary` column lets the receiver identify those grains instead of silently
# treating their visible area and perimeter as complete. `isBoundary` flags every grain
# that owns a segment with no grain on the other side. That covers the grains at the map
# edge and the grains around an unindexed region inside the map.
#
# Lengths are in the map's measurement unit and areas in its square. This map uses
# micrometres, so the unit is included in each relevant column name.
# [Shape Parameters](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ShapeParameters_py.html) defines these quantities. Any other scalar
# grain property can be appended in the same way.

# The reloaded rows retain their values and descriptive headings. Adding the orientation
# columns makes the table self-contained only when the receiving program also knows the
# Forsterite crystal symmetry and the crystal and specimen reference frames. A reference
# frame is the frame in which the data are expressed.

# A CSV file has no standard place for this context. Accompany it with a README or
# structured metadata that records the source, phase symmetries, spatial and angular
# units, Euler convention, reference frames, reconstruction threshold, size cutoff, and

# ## Export a VPSC texture
#
# `export` with `interface='VPSC'` writes the weighted texture format used by the VPSC crystal-plasticity
# code. It accepts Bunge, Kocks, or Roe Euler angles and normalises the supplied weights
# to sum to one.
#
# Here the weights are observed areas on a two-dimensional section. Treating those area
# fractions as three-dimensional volume fractions is a modelling assumption, not a
# conversion performed by MTEX.

# %% [markdown]
# The printed sum is one to the precision stored in the text file. The VPSC header also
# records the Euler convention and number of orientations, but the phase symmetry and
# reference frames still need companion metadata.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Export polygon geometry
#
# Each grain outline is stored as one or more closed loops. The property `grains.loops`
# holds, for every grain, its loops as lists of vertex indices in walk order. These
# indices refer to `grains.V`, the vertex list of the grains.
#
# A grain that encloses another grain has an outer loop followed by one or more inner
# loops. This is the same enclosure described from the outside as a hole and from the
# inside as an inclusion. A loop is written with its first vertex repeated at the end.

# %%

# The blue area is the first grain that does not touch the map edge. The black markers
# trace the vertex walk that will be written, including the repeated endpoint that closes
# the loop. These are smoothed coordinates, not the original pixel staircase.
#
# The following file contains every loop of every Forsterite grain. Both `grainId` and
# `loopId` are needed: a grain ID groups loops into grains, while a loop ID keeps an outer
# outline separate from enclosure outlines.

# ## Export the boundary network
#
# A grain boundary is a segment between two neighbouring EBSD measurements that belong to
# different grains. The boundary table below uses the unsmoothed network so each row
# retains that measurement-level meaning. It excludes segments next to grains removed by
# the size cutoff.

      'segmentDisorientation_degree': gB.misorientation.angle() / degree}

head(TB)

# %% [markdown]
# `gB` stores one row per boundary segment. The two IDs identify its neighbouring grains.
# The angle is the disorientation between the adjacent measurements across that segment,
# not the disorientation between the two grain mean orientations. Continue with
# [Grain Boundary Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryProperties_py.html) before exporting further segment
# quantities.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Save the objects
#
# If the data will be read by the same installation, Python's `pickle` preserves the
# complete objects more conveniently than separate text tables, as MATLAB's `save` does.
# Saving the source map with both grain lists keeps the measurements available for later
# checks; the processing history still belongs in the companion metadata. Such pickles
# are not readable by other software and are not guaranteed to load in a future version.
# For long-term archiving, prefer documented ASCII tables such as those above together
# with the source data and companion metadata. No one of these tables replaces the
# complete objects.

# ## Technical details
#
# MATLAB's `table` and `writetable` are a dictionary of columns and the `csv` module,
# `readtable` the same module reading; `head` is a small function of the page. The grain
# loops are `grains.loops`, lists of index arrays into `grains.V` without the closing
# vertex, where MATLAB's `poly` concatenates the loops with their first vertex repeated
# and indexes `allV`. MATLAB's `save` is Python's `pickle`.
