# # Vector-Valued Orientation Functions
#
# A scalar orientation function assigns one number to each orientation. A vector-valued
# orientation function assigns an array of numbers instead:
#
# $$ f\colon \mathrm{SO}(3) \to \mathbb{R}^n. $$
#
# This is useful when several orientation-dependent quantities share the same nodes,
# symmetries and approximation method. MTEX stores the components together so that they can
# be interpolated and manipulated as one array of functions.
#
# ## How evaluations are arranged
#
# The nodes come first in an evaluated array. The dimensions of the vector-valued `SO3Fun`
# follow them.
#
# Consider four nodes $R_1,\ldots,R_4$ and six scalar functions arranged as a
# $3\mathbin{\times}2$ array. Evaluation returns an array $F$ of shape $(4, 3, 2)$:
#
# $$ F[:,:,0]=\begin{pmatrix}
# f_1(R_1)&f_2(R_1)&f_3(R_1)\\
# f_1(R_2)&f_2(R_2)&f_3(R_2)\\
# f_1(R_3)&f_2(R_3)&f_3(R_3)\\
# f_1(R_4)&f_2(R_4)&f_3(R_4)
# \end{pmatrix}, \qquad
# F[:,:,1]=\begin{pmatrix}
# f_4(R_1)&f_5(R_1)&f_6(R_1)\\
# f_4(R_2)&f_5(R_2)&f_6(R_2)\\
# f_4(R_3)&f_5(R_3)&f_6(R_3)\\
# f_4(R_4)&f_5(R_4)&f_6(R_4)
# \end{pmatrix}. $$
#
# The harmonic coefficients are arranged the other way round: the last dimension of the
# coefficient array stores all Fourier coefficients of one scalar function, and the function
# array's dimensions come before it. This coefficient dimension is an implementation detail.
# Indexing and `shape` report only the $3\mathbin{\times}2$ function array seen by the user.
#
# ## Interpolate several components from samples
#
# First construct a list of approximately $10^5$ orientations. The crystal and specimen
# symmetries determine the fundamental region sampled by the grid.

#
# Function arrays follow ordinary array conventions. They can be concatenated, indexed and

# ## Integrals and component-wise reductions

# ## Minima and maxima
#
# With a single argument, `min` and `max` find a global extremum of every component
# separately. They return numeric arrays, with the positions, and require real-valued
# functions. Marking `SO3F4` as real enforces the coefficient symmetry required by this
# search.

# Passing an axis as `min(SO3F, axis=d)` instead computes a pointwise minimum along that
# component axis. The result is again a vector-valued `SO3FunHarmonic`. Since `SO3F4` is
# $2\mathbin{\times}5$, the following reduction leaves five functions.

# ## Pointwise products
#
# The product `*` of two functions is evaluated pointwise in orientation space. It is not
# the usual matrix product between the two function arrays. Both operands must have the same
# symmetries, so the symmetry of `SO3F1` is set explicitly before multiplication, and its
# two functions are arranged as a column so that they multiply the rows of `SO3F4`.

#
# ## Technical Details
#
# The port keeps a list of functions in NumPy's layout: the coefficients on the last axis of
# `fhat`, where MATLAB has them on the first; a list of $n$ functions has the shape `(n,)`,
# where MATLAB's is $n\times 1$, and multiplying it with a $2\times5$ array needs the
# column `reshape(2, 1)`. An axis is counted from zero, MATLAB's `sum(SO3F1, 1)` being
# `sum(SO3F1, axis=0)`; `min(f)` returns the values with their positions. A function built
# from coefficients alone has the triclinic crystal frame on its right side where MATLAB's
# has the specimen frame, so `SO3F1.CS` is set to that of `SO3F4`. Orientations take a
# frame at construction, so the relabelled nodes are built anew from their rotations, and
# the Dubna ODF is evaluated at the rotations of the triclinic nodes. The complex fourth
# root of $ab$ is taken of complex numbers, as MATLAB's power of a negative number gives.
# The function of the quadrature example is built from the quaternion components $a, b, c$
# of a rotation, which depend on which of $\pm q$ represents it; the port and MATLAB choose
# differently, so the four functions and their spectra differ from MATLAB's.
