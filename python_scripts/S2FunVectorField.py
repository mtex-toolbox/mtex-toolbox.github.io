# # Spherical Vector Fields
#
# A spherical vector field assigns a three-dimensional vector to every direction on the
# sphere. The input direction is a point in the field's domain; the output vector is the
# value stored there.
#
# The output need not lie in the plane tangent to the sphere. For example, a general field
# may have radial and tangential parts. The gradient of a scalar `S2Fun` is a special case
# whose values are tangential.
#
# MTEX represents this mapping with [S2VectorField](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2VectorField.S2VectorField.html). This
# page constructs a harmonic representation, evaluates it, combines fields, and reads its
# two- and three-dimensional plots.
#
# ## Constructing a field from a function
#
# Define a function that keeps the $x$ and $y$ components of its input and sets the $z$
# component to zero. It accepts `vector3d` directions and returns `vector3d` values.

# %%
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

f = lambda v: vector3d(v.x, v.y, 0 * v.x)

# %% [markdown]
# Passing the function to the constructor computes a harmonic approximation. The result is
# an `S2VectorFieldHarmonic`.

# %%
sVF2 = S2VectorFieldHarmonic(f, bandwidth=4)

# %% [markdown]
# The explicit [quadrature](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2VectorFieldHarmonic.quadrature.html) call is equivalent.

# %%
sVF2q = S2VectorFieldHarmonic.quadrature(f, bandwidth=4)

# %% [markdown]
# Evaluate the field as one would evaluate a scalar spherical function. At specimen X the
# value is specimen X, whereas at specimen Z it vanishes.

# %%
vector3d.cat(sVF2.eval(xvector), sVF2.eval(zvector))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Constructing a field from sampled values
#
# If directions and their vector values are already available, use
# [interpolate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2VectorFieldHarmonic.interpolate.html). Here the samples come from the same
# function so that the two construction routes can be compared.

# %%
nodes = equispacedS2Grid(points=2000)
nodes = nodes.flatten()
values = f(nodes)

sVF1 = S2VectorFieldHarmonic.interpolate(nodes, values, bandwidth=4)

# The small maximum discrepancy on an independent grid comes from fitting the finite
# harmonic representation to sampled values.

# ## Constructing a field from scalar components
#
# A harmonic vector field stores its Cartesian components as scalar `S2FunHarmonic`
# objects. Three entries supply the $x$, $y$, and $z$ components directly.

# %%
xyzComponents = [sVF2.x, sVF2.y, sVF2.z]
sVF4 = S2VectorFieldHarmonic(xyzComponents)
sVF4

# %% [markdown]
# Two entries supply $x$ and $y$, and the evaluator sets $z$ to zero. Earlier documentation
# described the two entries as polar angle and azimuth; that is not the behaviour of the
# current constructor.

# %%
xyComponents = [sVF2.x, sVF2.y]
sVF3 = S2VectorFieldHarmonic(xyComponents)
sVF3

# %% [markdown]
# Evaluating the two-component field makes the zero $z$ component explicit.

# %%
sVF3.eval(xvector)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Arithmetic and derived quantities
#
# Addition and subtraction act pointwise. The second operand may be another vector field or
# one fixed `vector3d`.

# %%
sumField = sVF1 + sVF2
shiftedField = sVF1 + vector3d(1, 0, 0)
differenceField = sVF1 - sVF2
shiftedDifference = sVF2 - vector3d(np.sqrt(2) / 2, np.sqrt(2) / 2, 0)

# %% [markdown]
# Multiplication and division by a scalar change every vector. Multiplying by an `S2Fun`
# gives each direction its own scalar weight.

# %%
scaledField = 2 * sVF1
reducedField = sVF1 / 4
weight = S2FunHarmonic.quadrature(lambda v: 1 + 0.2 * v.z, bandwidth=2)
weightedField = sVF1 * weight

# A pointwise dot product returns a scalar `S2Fun`. Its second operand may be a vector field
# or one fixed vector.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# A pointwise cross product returns another vector field and accepts the same two kinds of
# second operand.

# %%
fieldCross = cross(sVF1, sVF2)
crossWithZ = cross(sVF1, vector3d(0, 0, 1))

# %% [markdown]
# [mean](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2VectorFieldHarmonic.mean.html) returns one mean `vector3d`.
# [norm](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2VectorFieldHarmonic.norm.html) returns the scalar function of pointwise vector
# lengths.

# ## Visualizing direction and magnitude
#
# Fix the plotting convention so specimen X points right and specimen Y points up. The
# default [plot](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2VectorField.plot.html) command draws a projected quiver plot;
# [quiver](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2VectorField.quiver.html) is an alias.

# %%

# Arrows are shortest near specimen Z and lengthen towards the equator. Their length shows
# the field magnitude, while their arrowhead shows the sense of each vector.
#
# [quiver3d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2VectorField.quiver3.html) attaches the same arrows to a three-dimensional
# sphere.

# %%
quiver3d(sVF2, resolution=15 * degree)

# %% [markdown]
# The sphere shows the input directions, not a surface that constrains the output. Arrows
# can therefore point away from the tangent plane. This is the visual distinction between a
# general vector field and a tangential field such as a gradient.

#
# The function of the lengths is expanded to twice the bandwidth of the field, at least 32,
# where MATLAB's has 250; it is no polynomial, so either is an approximation. MATLAB's
# `[a, b]` of vectors is `vector3d.cat(a, b)`, `.*` and `./` are `*` and `/`.
