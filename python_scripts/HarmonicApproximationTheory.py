# # Harmonic Approximation from Discrete Data
#
# [Approximating Orientation-Dependent Functions from Discrete Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunApproximationTheory_py.html)
# defines the approximation problem and compares the available models. This page assumes
# that a harmonic model is appropriate and shows how to control its bandwidth,
# regularisation, sample weights, and iterative solver.
#
# Harmonic approximation is particularly useful for a general physical response that is not
# a density function. It also handles large numbers of sample orientations without placing
# one kernel at every observation. Noisy experimental data should be approximated rather
# than interpolated exactly, because an exact fit would reproduce the noise.
#
# ## A noisy data set
#
# Start with the same orientation-dependent data as on the overview page. The standard
# deviation of the added noise is 5 percent of the standard deviation of the supplied values.

# The strongest regions still occupy the same sections as in the original data, but
# neighbouring markers now fluctuate. A fitted surface should recover the broad regions
# without chasing those point-to-point changes.
#
# ## Start with bandwidth
#
# [interp](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/rotation.interp.html) selects a harmonic fit with the flag `'harmonic'`.
# Internally it calls [SO3FunHarmonic.interpolate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunHarmonic.interpolate.html). The
# bandwidth is the largest harmonic degree in the fitted series. A low bandwidth limits the
# number of unknown coefficients and therefore limits how quickly the function can vary.
#
# Set `regularisation` to zero temporarily so that the effect of bandwidth is visible on
# its own.

# There are more samples than coefficients in this bandwidth-17 fit, so the least-squares

#
# Raising the bandwidth to 32 introduces more coefficients than samples. This makes the
# system underdetermined. It is the opposite of oversampling: oversampling means having more
# independent samples than unknowns.

# The higher-bandwidth surface follows the samples more closely, so its residual is smaller.
# The narrow peaks and alternating ripples between them are evidence of overfitting. If
# LSQR reaches its iteration limit, treat the displayed residual as an unconverged value
# rather than the optimum of the least-squares problem.
#
# ## Read the spectrum
#
# [plotSpectrum](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.plotSpektra.html) summarizes the coefficient energy at each harmonic
# degree. It reveals high-frequency content that can be difficult to distinguish in a
# section plot.

# The bandwidth-17 spectrum stops before the high degrees are available. For bandwidth 32,
# the energy fails to decay towards the cutoff and even increases at high degrees. That
# high-degree tail matches the oscillations in the preceding section plot and is a
# practical overfitting diagnostic.
#
# ## Add regularisation
#
# Tikhonov regularisation penalizes high-degree coefficient energy. It lets you retain a
# bandwidth high enough for sharp real features while making oscillatory solutions more
# expensive.
#
# Current MTEX uses $\lambda=10^{-8}$ by default and a Sobolev index $s=2$. Older versions of
# this example documented $5\mathbin{\cdot}10^{-7}$ as the default. That value is retained
# here as an explicit smoothing choice, not as the current default. A suitable value depends
# on the data and should be checked rather than accepted automatically.

# The bandwidth remains 32, but the unsupported narrow peaks are suppressed. The residual at

#

# Strong regularisation removes almost all high-degree energy. As $\lambda$ decreases, the
# tail rises. Choose a value before the tail becomes dominated by high-degree energy, then
# confirm the choice against held-out data or independent physical expectations.
#
# ## Change the Sobolev index
#
# The Sobolev index controls how quickly the penalty grows with harmonic degree. A smaller
# index penalizes high degrees less strongly. The value of $\lambda$ must therefore be
# reconsidered whenever $s$ changes.

# Both pairs use $\lambda=0.001$. The $s=1$ panel retains more fine-scale variation because
# its high-degree penalty grows more slowly. Matching $\lambda$ numerically does not mean
# that the two fits have equal smoothing.
#
# ## Weight nonuniform or unequal samples
#
# Weighted least squares controls how strongly each sample contributes to the data residual.
# Use `weights='equal'` when every observation should count equally. Use
# `weights='Voronoi'` to compensate for nonuniform sampling by orientation-space cell volume,
# or pass one numeric weight per sample when measurement uncertainties are known.
#
# MTEX computes Voronoi weights by default for fewer than 10,000 samples. It uses equal
# weights for larger sets because the Voronoi calculation is time-consuming. This data set
# has slightly more than that threshold, so its default weights are equal. The explicit
# forms are:
#
# ```python
# SO3F = interp(ori, val, 'harmonic', weights='equal')
# SO3F = interp(ori, val, 'harmonic', weights='Voronoi')
# SO3F = interp(ori, val, 'harmonic', weights=measurementWeights)
# ```
#
# Numeric weights describe relative confidence or integration volume. They do not impose
# nonnegativity and do not turn a harmonic fit into a density.
#
# ## Control LSQR convergence
#
# LSQR stops when it reaches its tolerance `tol` or iteration limit `maxIter`. Their defaults
# are `1e-3` and `100`. A smaller tolerance requests a more accurate iterative solution, but
# the iteration limit may stop the solver first. Premature stopping can itself have a
# regularizing effect, so it must not be confused with convergence.
#
# With `withParameters=True` the direct interpolation method also returns the LSQR
# diagnostics. The first entry is the exit flag, the second the relative residual, and the
# third the number of iterations.

# %% [markdown]
# Compare the flags before comparing the residuals. If the tight-tolerance run stops at 100
# iterations, increase `maxIter` deliberately and check whether the fit and validation error
# materially change.
#
# Earlier code on this page printed `norm(f.eval(ori)-val)+5e-7*norm(f,2)` as the "energy
# functional". That expression is not the minimized objective: it omits the squared norms,
# uses a fixed historical $\lambda$, and does not reproduce the coefficient weights used
# internally.
#
# ## The maths behind harmonic approximation
#
# A bandlimited harmonic function is a finite series of [Wigner-D functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/WignerFunctions_py.html):
#
# $$ f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^N \sum_{k,l=-n}^n
# \hat f_n^{k,l} D_n^{k,l}(x). $$
#
# The coefficient vector $\mathbf{\hat f}$ is chosen to minimize the data residual at the
# $M$ sample pairs $(x_m,v_m)$. Without regularisation, the problem is
#
# $$ \min_f \sum_{m=1}^M \lvert f(x_m)-v_m \rvert^2. $$
#
# With Tikhonov regularisation, MTEX minimizes
#
# $$ \min_f \left[\sum_{m=1}^M \lvert f(x_m)-v_m \rvert^2
# + \lambda \lVert f\rVert_{H^s}^2\right], $$
#
# where the implemented Sobolev penalty is
#
# $$ \lVert f\rVert_{H^s}^2 = \sum_{n=0}^N
# (1+n(n+1))^s \sum_{k,l=-n}^n
# \lvert\hat f_n^{k,l}\rvert^2. $$
#
# Larger $s$ increases the relative cost of high-degree coefficients. Larger $\lambda$
# increases the overall influence of that cost.
#
# The Fourier matrix has entries $F_{m,(n,k,l)}=D_n^{k,l}(x_m)$. MTEX does not need to form
# this dense matrix explicitly. LSQR repeatedly applies the matrix and its adjoint, and MTEX
# evaluates those products with Wigner transforms and the nonequispaced fast Fourier
# transform (NFFT). This is why lowering bandwidth reduces the number of unknowns and the
# computational cost; it does not make the mathematical Fourier matrix sparse.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB's second output of `SO3FunHarmonic.interpolate` is `withParameters=True` here, the
# flag, the relative residual and the iterations of LSQR; the noise is drawn by NumPy.
# MATLAB's LSQR evaluates the series at the nodes through an NFSOFT of cutoff parameter 1,
# not the accurate one: on the noise-free values and $\lambda=5\mathbin{\cdot}10^{-7}$ its
# fit misses the data by 0.051 under that transform, the port's by 0.053, but evaluated
# accurately MATLAB's misses it by 0.206. The port's transforms are exact, so its residuals
# of the bandwidth-32 fits, 0.0013 and 0.0062, are the ones of the least-squares problem
# where MATLAB reports 0.0159 and 0.0239.
# MATLAB draws a sigma section of a triclinic function on the upper hemisphere only, since it
# takes the plane normal $c^*$ as antipodal and so equivalent to $-c^*$; that hides half of
# the orientations, among them the peak of the Dubna data. The port draws both hemispheres,
# so a section is a pair of discs and the layouts have twice MATLAB's columns.
