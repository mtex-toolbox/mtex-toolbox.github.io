# # Data Correction
#
# Diffraction counts are not pole densities. The detector also records background
# radiation, and tilting the specimen may reduce the measured intensity through
# defocusing. Isolated bad measurements and an unknown scale introduce further errors.
#
# This page prepares measured pole figures for ODF reconstruction. It assumes the
# pole-figure idea from [Pole Figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureAnalysis.html) and the import checks from
# [Import](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureImport_py.html).
#
# A `PoleFigure` behaves like an array of measured values. Pole figures can be selected,
# added and scaled, while individual values can be selected, overwritten or deleted.

# ## Splitting signal and background
#
# The display and plot show four entries. The first and third are the two complete
# intensity scans, with 679 specimen directions each. The second and fourth are sparse
# background scans with 16 directions each.
#
# Each background panel is a single radial line of points running from the centre of the
# disc outward: the 16 directions share one azimuth and differ only in polar angle. They
# belong to the complete scan with the same Miller index. A list of positions in brackets
# selects entries of the `PoleFigure` object.

# %%
pf_complete = pf[[0, 2]]
pf_background = pf[[1, 3]]

# %% [markdown]
# ## Arithmetic with pole figures
#
# Arithmetic uses the same syntax as arithmetic with numbers. The following weighted sum
# demonstrates addition and scaling without changing `pf`.

# %%
pf_weighted = 2 * pf[0] + 3 * pf[2]

# %% [markdown]
# The weights above are arbitrary and the two entries have different Miller indices. This
# is an API example, not a physical correction or an example of an unresolved diffraction
# peak.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Background and defocusing
#
# [correct](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.correct.html) applies correction measurements that have already
# been obtained. It does not infer background or defocusing from the measured pole figure.
#
# With `background`, MTEX interpolates each sparse background scan onto the directions of
# its complete scan and subtracts it. Because these background points differ only in
# polar angle, that interpolation is a spline in the polar angle alone. The Geesthacht
# data contain the background measurements needed for this operation.

# %%
pf = correct(pf_complete, background=pf_background)

# compare the first scan before and after background subtraction

mtexColorbar()

correctedI = pf.intensities
print(f'Corrected counts: min {np.min(correctedI):.0f}, mean {np.mean(correctedI):.0f}, max {np.max(correctedI):.0f}')

# %% [markdown]
# The left panel is the raw (104) scan and the right panel is the corrected scan on the
# same colour range. Background subtraction preserves the broad intensity pattern while
# lowering every value. The corrected counts run from 7 to 631, with an arithmetic mean of
# 273.
#
# Defocusing is different: it is a tilt-dependent loss of signal, so the correction is a
# division. Supply a defocusing measurement and, when available, its own background
# measurement:
#
#     pf = correct(pf, background=pf_bg, defocusing=pf_def, defocusingBackground=pf_def_bg)
#
# MTEX subtracts `pf_bg` from `pf`, subtracts `pf_def_bg` from `pf_def`, and divides the
# first result by the second. The correction measurements must match the pole figures
# physically; interpolation only adapts their sampled directions.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Normalization
#
# Pole density is reported in multiples of a random distribution (mrd). Its mean over a
# complete pole figure is 1, so [normalize](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.normalize.html) divides each
# complete scan by its quadrature-weighted mean.

# %%
pf_normalized = normalize(pf)
plot(pf_normalized)
mtexColorbar()

normalizedI = pf_normalized.intensities
normalizedMean = mean(pf_normalized)
print(f'Normalized mrd: min {np.min(normalizedI):.2f}, max {np.max(normalizedI):.2f}; '
      f'pole-figure means {normalizedMean[0]:.2f} and {normalizedMean[1]:.2f}')

# %% [markdown]
# The pattern has not moved; only the colour scale has changed. Values now run from 0.03
# to 2.27 mrd, and both pole figures have mean 1. They can therefore be compared with
# normalized measurements from another specimen.
#
# MATLAB reports 2.15 for the same data. Its two scans carry different antipodal flags
# after the correction, so their quadrature weights differ although their specimen
# directions are identical. Here both scans are axes, as diffraction data are, and both
# are weighted the same way.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Incomplete pole figures
#
# Direct normalization fails for an incomplete pole figure. The unmeasured part of the
# sphere also carries pole density, and its contribution is exactly what is unknown.
#
# One route is to reconstruct an ODF first. The ODF fills in the unmeasured part, and
# `normalize(pf, odf)` determines the scale against recalculated values at the measured
# directions. ODF reconstruction is explained in
# [ODF Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html).

# %%
odf = calcODF(pf)
pf_normalized_odf = normalize(pf, odf)

plot(pf_normalized_odf)
mtexColorbar()

odfNormalizedMean = mean(pf_normalized_odf)
normalizationDifference = 100 * np.max(np.abs(odfNormalizedMean - 1))
print(f'Largest ODF-based scale difference: {normalizationDifference:.2f} percent')

# %% [markdown]
# These pole figures are complete, so the direct and ODF-based scales differ by at most
# 0.02 percent. Their plots are consequently almost indistinguishable. On incomplete data
# the two procedures need not agree.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Outliers
#
# A single bad measurement can distort a reconstruction because the solver has no reason
# to distrust it. [isOutlier](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.isOutlier.html) marks values that disagree with
# the mean of their neighbourhood.
#
# The default threshold is two standard deviations for each pole figure. Review the
# flagged points in the measurement context instead of treating the default as an
# automatic quality criterion.
#
# To make the operation visible, first spoil 100 random measurements.

# %%
rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
ind = rng.permutation(pf.intensities.size)[:100]
factor = 3 + rng.random(100)
I = pf.intensities
I[ind] *= factor

# %% [markdown]
# The spoiled measurements appear as isolated bright dots above the broad texture
# pattern. Deleting selected entries keeps the complement of a logical condition, as it
# does for an ordinary NumPy array.

# %%
condition = isOutlier(pf)
nFirstPass = np.count_nonzero(condition)
print(f'Outliers removed on first pass: {nFirstPass}')
pf = pf[~condition]

# %% [markdown]
# The first pass removes about half of the 100 inserted values. An outlier beside another
# outlier raises the local mean and can hide behind it. Recomputing the condition after
# deletion catches roughly half of the rest.

# %%
condition = isOutlier(pf)
nSecondPass = np.count_nonzero(condition)
print(f'Outliers removed on second pass: {nSecondPass}')
pf = pf[~condition]

# %% [markdown]
# Most isolated bright points have disappeared after the second pass. The remaining
# inserted values were not separated far enough from their local neighbourhood to pass
# this particular threshold.
#
# Deletion removes both the intensity and its specimen direction. It does not replace the
# value by an interpolated estimate.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Any other condition
#
# Nothing about the selection is specific to outliers. Any logical condition on the
# intensities can select values for deletion or replacement.
#
# The next threshold is deliberately artificial: it demonstrates replacement by capping
# counts at 500, not a recommended experimental correction. `min(pf, 500)` clips every
# intensity above 500 to that value.

# %%
condition = pf.intensities > 500
nCapped = np.count_nonzero(condition)
nRemaining = pf.intensities.size
print(f'Values capped at 500: {nCapped} of {nRemaining}')
pf = min(pf, 500)

plot(pf)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The cap affects about a hundred of the remaining measurements. They now share the same
# top colour, flattening the bright parts of the plot and showing why a numerical
# condition needs a physical justification.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Rotating pole figures
#
# A reference frame is the coordinate system in which the specimen directions are
# expressed. If import assigned the wrong specimen frame, fix the import as described in
# [Import](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureImport_py.html) whenever possible.
#
# The following example deliberately rotates the measured directions by 100 degrees about
# the x-axis. This moves the data; it is not a change of plotting convention, which only
# controls where axes are drawn.

# %%
rot = rotation.byAxisAngle(xvector, 100 * degree)
pf_rotated = rotate(pf, rot)

plot(pf_rotated, antipodal=True)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# [rotate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.rotate.html) leaves the intensities unchanged and applies the
# rotation to their measured directions. The measured cap tips across the equator, and
# `antipodal` folds the part below the equator back into the same disc.
#
# Both panels come out filled edge to edge, and the vertical arcs across them are the
# rotated ring sampling rather than gaps in it. Drop `antipodal` and the (110) panel opens
# over the part of the sphere that was never measured. That is why correcting the specimen
# frame at import is preferable to an avoidable rotation later.

# ## Technical Details
#
# An integer, a slice or a list in brackets picks pole figures, a boolean mask picks
# measurements, so MATLAB's `pf({1,3})` is `pf[[0, 2]]` and `pf(condition) = []` is
# `pf = pf[~condition]`. `pf.intensities` is a copy of all intensities in one array;
# changed values go back through the same property. The cap is `min(pf, 500)`, MATLAB's
# `min(pf, 500)` as well. The spoiled measurements are drawn from a seeded generator so
# that the page rebuilds the same; MATLAB's `randperm` is not seeded, and the counts of
# the two passes vary with the draw.
