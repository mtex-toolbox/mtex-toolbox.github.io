# # Texture evolution in rolled magnesium during uniaxial tension
#
# This page compares two Taylor-model predictions for rolled magnesium pulled along its
# rolling direction. The starting sheet has a basal fibre texture, but the two
# temperatures use different slip resistances and reach different strains. The
# calculation shows how those choices change both the texture and the activity assigned
# to each deformation family. The motivating tension experiments reached approximately 30
# percent strain at room temperature and 70 percent at 250 degrees Celsius.

# ## Set the crystal and specimen frames
#
# The sheet is orthotropic, so its specimen frame carries the orthorhombic group. A
# rolling frame names the specimen axes rolling direction (RD), transverse direction
# (TD), and normal direction (ND), and every pole figure below is drawn and annotated in
# those axes. Here the tension axis is RD.

# ## Build the initial basal fibre texture
#
# In an ideal rolled magnesium sheet, the crystal c-axes are parallel to ND while
# rotations about that axis are random. A fibre ODF represents that basal fibre texture
# directly.

# The basal poles form one maximum at ND. The prismatic poles form a ring because the
# initial model contains every rotation about the c-axis with equal probability. RD is
# also the tension direction in all three plots.

# ## Choose temperature-dependent families
#
# The [Slip Systems](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SlipSystems_py.html) page defines critical resolved shear stress (CRSS)
# and explains why hexagonal materials have no universal slip set. CRSS depends on
# material, temperature, and experiment, and published values vary widely. The
# dimensionless values below are illustrative ratios normalized to basal slip, not a
# universal magnesium parameter set. At room temperature, basal slip commonly dominates
# magnesium deformation and extension twins can also have a low CRSS. For this basal
# texture, tension perpendicular to the c-axis does not activate extension twinning. The
# model therefore includes only compression twins and assigns them the largest CRSS.

# ## Define the two strain states
#
# Plastic incompressibility requires each infinitesimal strain tensor to have zero trace.
# The room-temperature case assumes unequal contraction along TD and ND. The 250-degree
# case assumes that this transverse anisotropy is negligible, so both directions contract
# equally.

# ## One-step approximation
#
# This page evaluates the spin only at the starting orientations and applies the entire
# 30 or 70 percent strain in one update. It is therefore an illustrative one-step

# Prismatic and pyramidal slip carry almost all deformation in this example. The warm
# CRSS ratios favour pyramidal slip over prismatic slip, whereas the order is reversed at
# room temperature. Compression-twin activity is below $3 \times 10^{-10}$ per crystal,
# nine to ten orders of magnitude under prismatic and pyramidal slip. Because the imposed
# total strains differ, compare the family ranking within a row rather than absolute bar
# heights between temperatures.

# ## Technical Details
#
# The sample has 5000 orientations where MATLAB's has 5280, and each Taylor program is
# solved by a simplex to a vertex of its optimal face where MATLAB's interior point
# returns a point inside it. The mean rotations are therefore 8.09 and 15.49 degrees for
# MATLAB's 8.32 and 15.42, and the family table 0.0254, 0.3882, 0.2806 at room
# temperature and 0.0506, 0.7546, 0.8184 at 250 degrees for MATLAB's 0.0220, 0.3722,
# 0.2948 and 0.0448, 0.7298, 0.8424. The compression twins are exactly 0 at a vertex,
# which the logarithmic bar chart cannot show, where the interior point leaves
# $2.3\times10^{-10}$ and $4.9\times10^{-11}$.
