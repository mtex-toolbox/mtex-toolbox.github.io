# # Select Grain Boundaries
#
# A grain boundary is stored as a list of short segments. Each segment lies between two
# neighbouring measurements that belong to different grains. Selecting boundaries
# therefore means indexing this list, and every selection returns another
# `grainBoundary` list.
#
# This page assumes that the map has already been divided into grains as in
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html). The
# [Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainBoundaries.html) overview explains how these segments represent
# an interface in a two-dimensional section.

# The black network contains every boundary segment in the cropped map. It includes
# boundaries between grains of one phase, boundaries between phases, and the outer rim of
# the scan.

# ## What the list contains
#
# Displaying `gB` reports the number and total length of the segments for every pair of
# phases that meets in the map.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# The rows involving `notIndexed` combine two situations. Some segments border a connected
# `notIndexed` area, whose diffraction patterns could not be indexed. Others lie on the
# outer rim, where a grain is cut off by the scan and has no neighbour on the other side.
# [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html) shows how to identify grains at that rim.

# %% [markdown]
# ## By the phases on either side
#
# Two phase names select segments between those phases. The first selection contains
# forsterite to forsterite boundaries, which separate differently oriented grains of the
# dominant phase.

# %%
gB_FoFo = gB['Fo', 'Fo']

hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The thick blue segments occur within the forsterite part of the phase map. They do not
# include its contacts with the other minerals.
#
# The next selection contains forsterite to enstatite boundaries. A phase boundary is not
# a separate object in MTEX. It is a grain boundary whose two neighbouring grains happen
# to differ in phase.

# %%
gB_FoEn = gB['Fo', 'En']

plot(ebsd)
hold(True)
plot(gB_FoEn, lineColor='darkgreen', micronbar='off', lineWidth=4)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The green segments follow only contacts between the forsterite and enstatite regions.
# They are two different crystals meeting, rather than two orientations of the same phase.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Why phase order matters
#
# The order of the phase names matters for more than readability. A misorientation is a
# rotation *from* one crystal *to* another, so reversing the names gives inverse
# misorientations. A misorientation axis expressed in crystal coordinates therefore refers
# to whichever crystal was named first.

# %%
mori = gB['Fo', 'En'].misorientation[0]
mori

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
inv(mori)

# %% [markdown]
# The two phase orders select the same physical segments, but reversing the sides also
# reverses the walk along every boundary chain. The segments are consequently not returned
# in the same row order. Corresponding segments have exactly inverse misorientations, but
# `gB['En', 'Fo'].misorientation[0]` is a different segment from the first one selected
# above.

# %% [markdown]
# ## By grain
#
# A boundary list is also available from the grains it belongs to. This is how to ask for
# the boundary of one grain or of a grain selection. Here `grains[72]` means the 73rd
# grain in the current list, not necessarily a grain whose ID is 73;
# [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html) explains the distinction between list position
# and grain ID.

# %% [markdown]
# The dark-blue outline includes every phase pair on the boundary of this grain. The
# displayed boundary summary names the phases on its far side.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Boundaries inside a grain
#
# `grains.innerBoundary` stores segments between two measurements *of the same grain*.
# They arise when the segmentation criterion separates two neighbouring pixels, but
# another path through the map still connects them into one phase-homogeneous grain. An
# orientation gradient that comes back around can produce exactly this situation.

# The display reports 11 inner-boundary segments in this barely deformed rock. The red
# segments sit inside connected grains rather than tracing complete grain outlines.
# Deformed material may contain many more, and
# [Subgrain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SubGrainBoundaries_py.html) explains how a two-threshold
# reconstruction preserves a systematic low-angle population.

# %% [markdown]
# ## By misorientation or another property
#
# Every segment carries its misorientation. A logical condition on the misorientation
# angle therefore selects segments in the same way as any NumPy logical index. Here the
# eligible set is first restricted to forsterite to forsterite boundaries, so every angle
# has one consistent pair of crystal symmetries.

# The grey segments are all eligible forsterite boundaries, while red marks only those
# above the chosen angle. The same pattern works with a condition on position, direction,
# length, or any other per-segment property; see
# [Grain Boundary Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryProperties_py.html).
#
# More specialised misorientation selections compare an axis, a complete rotation, or a
# coincidence site lattice relationship. They are developed in
# [Twist and Tilt](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TiltAndTwistBoundaries_py.html), [Twinning](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TwinningBoundaries_py.html), and
# [CSL](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CSLBoundaries_py.html).

# [Boundary Plots](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryPlots_py.html) shows how to colour the selected segments by

# [Grain Boundary Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryProperties_py.html) then develops the per-segment
# values from which more selections can be built.

# ## Technical Details
#
# A pair of phase names in brackets selects segments, MATLAB's `gB('Fo','Fo')`, and a
# boolean array selects them the same way. `calcGrains` returns the grains alone and
# writes the grain of every measurement into the map it was given, so MATLAB's
# `[grains, ebsd] = calcGrains(ebsd, ...)` is one assignment here; as there, a not indexed
# measurement inside a grain takes its phase without an orientation. The grains are
# numbered along x first where MATLAB numbers them along y first, so MATLAB's `grains(47)`,
# the diopside grain with 23 forsterite and 7 enstatite segments, is `grains[72]` here.
