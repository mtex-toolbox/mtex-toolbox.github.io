# # Denoising Orientation Maps
#
# Every measured orientation has uncertainty. Some errors are systematic: an incorrect
# pattern centre or reference frame can bias a whole map in a related way. A filter
# cannot discover that bias from the map alone. Check the setup as described in
# [Reference Frames](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) before treating point-to-point variation
# as noise.
#
# Random errors appear instead as scatter between nearby measurements. This page reduces
# that scatter while trying to preserve real orientation gradients and abrupt changes
# inside grains. Filling measurements whose phase is `notIndexed` is a different
# operation; see [Filling Missing Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDFilling_py.html).
#
# The examples assume that you can reconstruct grains and read an orientation map. Those
# steps are introduced in [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) and
# [IPF Maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html). A quantitative comparison of the filters and their effect
# on KAM and GND calculations is given by
# [Hielscher et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576719009075).

# The grains appear almost uniformly coloured. This does not show that the measurements
# are noise-free: the IPF key displays absolute orientation, and sub-degree differences
# produce only small colour changes.
#
# A more sensitive view compares every orientation with the original mean orientation of
# its grain. Hue represents the misorientation axis and saturation represents its angle.
# This colour scheme follows
# [Thomsen et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2017.06.021).

# Two patterns now separate. Smooth colour gradients across the larger grains record
# lattice bending in the deformed crystal. Pixel-to-pixel speckle superposed on those
# gradients is the signature to reduce. The printed mean contains both effects, so its
# decrease is a diagnostic of smoothing rather than a direct measurement of the noise
# amplitude.

# %% [markdown]
# ## How `smooth` uses the grain structure
#
# Every filter on this page is applied with [smooth](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.smooth.html). Because
# `calcGrains` assigned `ebsd.grainId`, `smooth` treats each grain separately. It
# therefore does not average orientations across a reconstructed grain boundary. An
# abrupt change inside one reconstructed grain is a subgrain boundary, and whether it
# survives depends on the filter.
#
# Denoising changes the orientations in the returned map. It does not reconstruct the
# grains or move their boundaries, which is why the same original boundaries are overlaid
# throughout. Reconstruct the grains again only if the denoised orientations should
# define a new segmentation.
#
# Two variational filters are useful in practice. The total variation filter favours
# sharp internal changes; the smoothing spline favours a continuously curved map.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The total variation filter
#
# The `halfQuadraticFilter` balances fidelity to the measured orientations against
# first-order smoothness over the map. Its default total variation model permits jumps,
# so it can preserve a subgrain boundary instead of averaging across it. This method for
# rotation-valued images is described by
# [Bergmann et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.3934/ipi.2016001) and builds on the total
# variation model of [Rudin et al. (1992)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-2789(92)90242-F).
#
# The property `F.alpha` controls the trade-off; larger values smooth more. The property
# `F.threshold` prevents smoothing across neighbour differences above its value. The
# default settings are used here. Their price is a tendency towards cartoon-like patches
# and staircases.

# %% [markdown]
# The isolated colour changes are largely gone, while extended gradients and sharp
# internal changes remain. Read the printed reduction together with the map: the
# remaining deviation includes real deformation and should not be driven to zero.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The smoothing spline filter
#
# The `splineFilter` is the filter that `smooth` uses when none is supplied. It
# penalizes curvature rather than first-order variation. The result is rounder than the
# total variation result, but fine subgrain boundaries are smoothed with the noise.
#
# In MATLAB it is the only filter on this page that selects its own regularization
# parameter, by generalized cross-validation with robust smoothing by default, following
# [Garcia (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2009.09.020); that automatic mode is not
# fully supported on hexagonal grids there. Here every variational filter takes a
# smoothing length, four lattice steps by default, and the spline is applied with that
# length.

# %%

# smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd, F)

# The printed mean deviation is close to the total variation result, but the spatial
# result is not the same: the spline makes the colour fields rounder and removes more of
# the fine internal structure.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Technical details - further filters
#
# The filters below are retained for comparison and completeness. In practice they are
# inferior to the two above for this map. The first three are sliding-window filters:
# each orientation is replaced by a value computed only from a local neighbourhood.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The mean filter
#
# The `meanFilter` replaces each orientation by a local mean. A radius of one gives the
# smallest neighbourhood.

# %%
F = meanFilter()
F.numNeighbours = 1

# smooth the data

# %% [markdown]
# The isolated speckle is weaker, but the extended colour fields have also spread. A
# local mean has no criterion for distinguishing a noisy jump from a real one inside the
# grain.
#
# Increasing `F.numNeighbours` broadens the spatial support. More noise is removed, at
# the cost of blurring every internal feature further.

# Compared with the preceding map, the broader patches and weaker narrow features show
# the cost of increasing the neighbourhood.

# ## The median filter
#
# A mean is pulled towards one bad measurement and averages across every internal step.
# The `medianFilter` selects the neighbouring orientation with the smallest mean distance
# to the others. It is therefore more robust to isolated outliers and more likely to
# preserve a subgrain boundary.

# %%
F = medianFilter()

# use a 7-by-7 window

# smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd, F)

# The map breaks into cartoon-like patches with visible steps. This staircase effect is
# what the median does to a gentle orientation gradient.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Kuwahara filter
#
# The `KuwaharaFilter` is also designed to survive outliers and preserve subgrain
# boundaries. It divides the neighbourhood into four overlapping quadrants and uses the
# mean of the most uniform one. The block structure in the result shows why it is rarely
# satisfactory in practice.

# Large rectangular colour patches follow the selected subwindows rather than the smooth
# gradients visible in the raw map.

# ## The infimal convolution filter
#
# The `infimalConvolutionFilter` combines first- and second-order penalties. A linear
# gradient can then survive where plain total variation tends to create a staircase,
# while a sharp internal boundary can remain. The model is described by
# [Bergmann et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-58771-4_36). This
# implementation is still under development and is not recommended for routine use. Its
# two weights, `alpha` for the first-order and `beta` for the second-order penalty, are
# derived from the smoothing length; MATLAB names them `lambda` and `mu`.

# %%
F = infimalConvolutionFilter()

# smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd, F)
ebsdS = ebsdS['indexed']

# plot the smoothed data on the fixed colour scale
colorKey.oriRef = grains.selectByGrainId(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation
plot(ebsdS, colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The result is smoother within gradients than the total variation map and sharper at
# internal steps than the spline map. It offers no practical advantage here that
# outweighs its experimental status.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Choosing a filter
#
# Use the `halfQuadraticFilter` when preserving subgrain boundaries matters. Use the
# `splineFilter` on a square grid when smooth gradients matter more. In either case, vary
# the smoothing strength and check that persistent spatial features remain; a lower mean
# deviation alone does not prove that the result is better.
#
# Denoising is usually preparation for a noise-sensitive calculation.
# [Kernel Average Misorientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDKAM_py.html) and
# [Grain Reference Orientation Deviation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGROD_py.html) continue with the same
# distinction between point-to-point scatter and real lattice bending.
