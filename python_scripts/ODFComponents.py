# # ODF Component Analysis
#
# A texture is often described by a handful of *components*. Each component has a
# preferred orientation and a surrounding population of similar orientations, usually
# produced by a deformation or recrystallisation process. Component analysis asks where
# these populations are and how much material to assign to each one.
#
# This page assumes the normalisation of an orientation distribution function (ODF)
# introduced in [ODF Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html) and the section geometry introduced in
# [Sigma Sections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SigmaSections_py.html). It compares three answers that must not be
# confused: peak density, volume inside a fixed angular radius, and a partition by modes.

# ## A Measured Texture
#
# The example is reconstructed from neutron pole figures of a quartz specimen.
# [The Dubna Example](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureDubna_py.html) follows the same data from the measured
# files. Here the zero-range method handles regions where no intensity was measured.

pf = mtexdata('dubna')

# %% [markdown]
# The twelve panels are slices through the same three-dimensional orientation space.
# Bright compact regions are candidate components, but a feature can continue into a
# neighbouring slice. Symmetry-equivalent appearances also represent the same physical
# orientation, not additional components.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Strongest Mode
#
# A *mode* is a local maximum of the ODF. The largest mode is the preferred orientation of
# the whole texture. [max](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.max.html) returns its density and its orientation.

# %%
peakValue, peakOri = max(odf)
peakValue

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
peakOri

# %% [markdown]
# The maximum is 110 multiples of a random distribution (mrd). This is a density, not a
# percentage of material. The black marker sits in the brightest region of the section
# plot.

# %%
annotate(peakOri, markerFaceColor='black')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Local Modes
#
# With `numLocal`, `max` returns the requested number of largest local maxima. Their
# values are sorted from largest to smallest.

# %%
localValue, localOri = max(odf, numLocal=3)
localValue

# %%
annotate(localOri[1:], markerFaceColor='red')

# %% [markdown]
# The three modes reach 110, 47, and 32 mrd. The black marker is the global mode and the
# red markers are the next two. Each lies in a bright neighbourhood; the markers locate
# peaks but do not define the extent of a component.
#
# These modes belong to the reconstructed ODF, not directly to the measured pole figures.
# Resolution, kernel halfwidth, and measurement noise can move or merge weak maxima.
# Check that a small mode persists under reasonable reconstruction or smoothing choices
# before assigning it to a physical process. [ODF Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html)
# explains those choices.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Volume Inside a Fixed Radius
#
# Peak density is not a measure of component importance. A sharp component can reach a
# large value while occupying little volume. A reproducible alternative is the fraction
# of material within a stated disorientation angle of the mode.
# [volume(odf, ori, delta)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.volume.html) integrates the ODF over that
# orientation-space ball.

# %%
delta = 10 * degree
ballPercent = 100 * volume(odf, localOri, delta)
ballPercent

# %% [markdown]
# The three balls contain 11, 5, and 4 percent of the material. Their sum is far below
# 100 percent because a $10^\circ$ ball is a small part of orientation space, not because
# the ODF is missing material. In a uniform texture the same ball would contain

# %%
uniformPercent = 100 * volume(uniformODF(odf.CS), localOri[0], delta)
uniformPercent

# %% [markdown]
# 0.17 percent. Dividing by that reference gives the enrichment over a uniform texture.

# %%
enrichment = ballPercent / uniformPercent
enrichment

# %% [markdown]
# The enrichments are 67, 31, and 24. Every value in this section depends on `delta`.
# Choosing it too large makes neighbouring balls overlap.

# %%
delta = 40 * degree
overlapPercent = 100 * volume(odf, localOri, delta)
overlapPercent

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
overlapTotal = np.sum(overlapPercent)
overlapTotal

# %% [markdown]
# At $40^\circ$ the three balls sum to 137 percent. The same orientations are counted in
# several balls, so the total can exceed 100 percent. These are three separate
# neighbourhood measurements, not volume fractions of disjoint components.

# %% [markdown]
# ## A Modal Partition
#
# One radius for every component is a strong assumption. Real components need not be
# spherical, and neighbouring ones can run into each other.
# [calcComponents](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcComponents.html) instead lets seed orientations climb the
# ODF gradient and groups seeds that reach the same mode.
#
# For this radial-basis ODF, the seeds are its kernel centres and their positive weights.
# For another representation, MTEX uses an equispaced orientation grid. The shares below
# are accumulated seed weights. They form a useful modal partition, but they are not
# integrals over uniquely defined geometric boundaries.

# %%
componentOri, componentFraction, _ = calcComponents(odf, verbose=False)
componentPercent = 100 * componentFraction
componentPercent

# %% [markdown]

# %%
retainedPercent = np.sum(componentPercent)
retainedPercent

# %% [markdown]
# The four modes contain 48, 22, 21, and 7 percent. They sum to 99 percent because nearly
# all positive seed weight reaches a retained mode. By default, very small modes may be
# discarded; use `exact=True` when retaining them matters.
#
# The open white circles show the modal centres. The leading centres agree with the
# maxima located by `max`, while the fourth circle appears because the earlier call
# requested only three local maxima.

#
# Fitting parametric components to an ODF rather than locating them is
# [Modeling](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFModeling_py.html). The single numbers that summarise a whole ODF are
# [Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFCharacteristics_py.html). Those are global descriptors, whereas the
# quantities on this page describe selected modes or their neighbourhoods.

# ## Technical Details
#
# `max(odf)` and `max(odf, numLocal=3)` return the pair of the values and the
# orientations, as MATLAB's two outputs do; `localOri[1:]` is MATLAB's `localOri(2:end)`.
# `volume` takes a list of orientations and returns one fraction per orientation;
# `calcComponents` returns its three outputs, the modes, their weights and the mode of every seed.
