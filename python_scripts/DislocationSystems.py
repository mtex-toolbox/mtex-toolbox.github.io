# # Dislocation Systems
#
# Plastic deformation in a crystal is carried by dislocations moving through
# its regular atomic lattice. A *dislocation* is a line defect rather than a
# microscopic displacement by itself.
#
# Two vectors describe its geometry. The Burgers vector $\mathbf b$ gives the
# lattice translation accumulated around the defect. The line vector
# $\mathbf l$ gives the direction of the defect line.
#
# MTEX represents a pure edge or screw geometry with a
# [`dislocationSystem`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/dislocationSystem.dislocationSystem.html). This page
# constructs both types and then prepares the systems used to estimate
# geometrically necessary dislocations from an EBSD map.

# ## Edge dislocations
#
# In a pure edge dislocation, the Burgers vector is perpendicular to the line
# vector. Start with a cubic crystal frame and two crystal directions.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('432')
bEdge = Miller(1, 1, 0, cs, 'uvw')
bEdge

# %%
lEdge = Miller(1, -1, -2, cs, 'uvw')
lEdge

# %% [markdown]
# The constructor checks that the two vectors are perpendicular or parallel.
# A general mixed dislocation cannot be entered with this constructor.

# %%
dSEdge = dislocationSystem(bEdge, lEdge)

# The grey arrow is the line vector, along which the defect runs. The red
# arrow is the Burgers vector, which gives the lattice shift across it.

# %%
arrow3d(1.3 * normalize(vector3d(lEdge)), faceColor=[0.45, 0.45, 0.45])
hold(True)
arrow3d(0.9 * normalize(vector3d(bEdge)), faceColor='red')
plt.axis('off')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Notice that the two arrows meet at a right angle. This orthogonality is the
# defining geometric feature of the edge system.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Screw dislocations
#
# In a pure screw dislocation, the Burgers vector and line vector are
# parallel. The same Burgers vector can therefore serve as both inputs.

# %%
bScrew = Miller(1, 1, 0, cs, 'uvw')
bScrew

# %%
lScrew = Miller(1, 1, 0, cs, 'uvw')
lScrew

# %%
dSScrew = dislocationSystem(bScrew, lScrew)
dSScrew

# %% [markdown]
# Draw the line vector longer so that both arrows remain visible when they
# lie on top of one another.

# %%
arrow3d(1.3 * normalize(vector3d(lScrew)), faceColor=[0.45, 0.45, 0.45])
hold(True)
arrow3d(0.9 * normalize(vector3d(bScrew)), faceColor='red')
plt.axis('off')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The coincident arrows show that the lattice shift is along the direction in
# which the defect runs. This parallelism distinguishes the screw system.

# ## Build systems from slip systems
#
# A [slip system](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SlipSystems_py.html) supplies a Burgers vector and a slip-plane
# normal. MTEX converts each slip system into an edge system with a line
# direction in the slip plane, and also adds the distinct screw systems.
#
# Here the 12 geometrically distinct FCC slip systems produce 12 edge and 6
# screw systems. The `'antipodal'` option identifies opposite shear senses
# before the conversion.

# %%
sSFcc = symmetrise(slipSystem.fcc(cs), 'antipodal')
dSFcc = dislocationSystem(sSFcc)
[sum(dSFcc.isEdge), sum(dSFcc.isScrew)]

# %% [markdown]
# The named constructor performs the corresponding conversion for the
# standard BCC family. It is a shortcut for constructing and symmetrising
# `slipSystem.bcc(cs)`, not for the FCC lines above.

# %%
dSBcc = dislocationSystem.bcc(cs)
[sum(dSBcc.isEdge), sum(dSBcc.isScrew)]

# %% [markdown]
# MTEX uses one half of the cubic slip direction as the Burgers vector during
# this conversion. It also uses one third of a hexagonal slip direction.
# Other lattices trigger a warning because the physical scale is ambiguous.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The dislocation tensor
#
# A dislocation system contributes the dyadic tensor
# $\mathbf b\otimes\hat{\mathbf l}$, where the hat denotes a unit line vector.
# This tensor is sometimes described informally as a deformation matrix.
# In MTEX it is a basis tensor for the dislocation-density tensor used on the
# next page.

# %%
dTBcc = dSBcc.tensor()
dTBcc

# %% [markdown]
# The tensor has the same length unit as the unit-cell axes because the line
# vector is normalized. MTEX labels this unit `au`; for a lattice specified
# in Angstrom, its entries are therefore in Angstrom.
#
# The Burgers-vector norm sets the scale of each basis tensor. For the unit
# cubic cell used here, a BCC $\langle111\rangle/2$ Burgers vector has length
# $\sqrt{3}/2$.

# %%
a = cs.aAxis.norm()
np.array([dSBcc[0].b.norm()[0], dSBcc[-1].b.norm()[0], np.sqrt(3) / 2 * a])

# %% [markdown]
# The earlier statement that both BCC and FCC Burgers vectors have length
# $\sqrt{3}a/2$ is not generally correct. An FCC
# $\langle110\rangle/2$ Burgers vector has length $a/\sqrt{2}$, as this check
# shows.

# %%
np.array([dSFcc[0].b.norm()[0], a / np.sqrt(2)])

# ## Set relative line energies
#
# The property `u` stores the relative line energy used when MTEX chooses a
# non-negative combination of systems. A directly constructed system has
# `u = 1` by default. Conversion from slip systems currently initializes
# `u = 2` for edge systems and `u = 1` for screw systems.
#
# Hull and Bacon give the elastic line energies
#
# $$ U_{\mathrm{screw}} = \frac{G b^2}{4\pi}
#    \ln\left(\frac{R}{r_0}\right), $$
#
# $$ U_{\mathrm{edge}} = \frac{1}{1-\nu}
#    U_{\mathrm{screw}}, $$
#
# where $G$ is the shear modulus, $b$ is the Burgers-vector length, $\nu$ is
# Poisson's ratio, $R$ is the outer cut-off radius, and $r_0$ is the
# dislocation-core radius.
#
# If all systems share the other factors, one convenient normalization is
# $U_{\mathrm{edge}}=1$ and $U_{\mathrm{screw}}=1-\nu$.

# %%
nu = 0.3
dSBcc.u[dSBcc.isEdge] = 1
dSBcc.u[dSBcc.isScrew] = 1 - nu

# %% [markdown]
# There is no single accepted way to set these weights. Another model may
# use `u = c * G * norm(b)**2`, with a model-dependent constant `c`.
# When $G$ is a shear modulus, this expression has units of energy per unit
# length; earlier wording on this page called it energy per length squared.
# Choose `u` for the material and model being compared rather than treating
# an MTEX default as a measured energy.
