# # Projection Based Shape Parameters
#
# Hold a grain up against the light and measure the width of its shadow. Turn it a little
# and measure again. The family of parameters on this page comes from that operation: the
# width of a grain as a function of direction.
#
# | quantity | meaning |
# |---|---|
# | `caliper` | caliper or Feret diameter in the map's length unit |
# | `diameter` | longest caliper in the map's length unit |
#
# Unlike a fitted [ellipse](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EllipseBasedParameters_py.html), which describes a grain by four
# numbers, the projection function keeps one value for every direction. It can therefore
# describe fabrics that one ellipse cannot.
#
# This page assumes that the grains have been [reconstructed](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html)
# and that selecting complete grains is familiar from
# [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html). [Grain Smoothing](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainSmoothing_py.html)
# explains why a boundary reconstructed from a pixel grid should be smoothed before its
# directions are measured. All measurements below describe two-dimensional grain
# sections, not the full three-dimensional grains.

# %% [markdown]
# A `caliper`, or Feret diameter, is the span of the grain after its vertices are
# projected onto a supplied direction. Traced over all directions, the caliper becomes a
# function. The direction is an axis, so values 180 degrees apart are identical.

#
# The relative difference between the two extrema is a simple measure of how far a grain
# is from having the same width in every direction. It is zero for a constant-width
# outline and approaches one as the minimum width becomes small. It measures directional
# elongation, not lobes or boundary roughness.

# ## Three ways to say which way a grain points
#
# The longest caliper and the long axis of the fitted ellipse usually agree, but not
# always. For rectangular particles they disagree badly: the longest caliper of a
# rectangle follows a diagonal. A strong alignment of rectangles can therefore produce a
# bimodal distribution of diagonals that no grain actually points along. The direction
# normal to the *shortest* caliper, `'shortestPerp'`, does not have this problem.

# %% [markdown]
# On a rectangle the longest caliper follows a diagonal while the long axis and the
# perpendicular to the shortest caliper both follow the long side, so those two arrows
# lie on top of each other and only the longest caliper stands apart.
#
# Which one to use is a decision about the material: use the long axis for roughly
# elliptical grains and the perpendicular to the shortest caliper for grains whose flat
# faces define their alignment.

# %% [markdown]
# ## From grains to a particle fabric: PAROR
#
# A shape preferred orientation, or SPO, is an alignment of grains as bodies. Projection
# lengths can be added over a population without first assigning one direction to every
# grain and without assuming that each grain is an ellipse. This construction is the
# PAROR method introduced by Panozzo.
#
# `caliper` accepts a list of directions and returns one projection length per grain and
# direction. The individual functions and their average can therefore be drawn directly.

# Each faint line is one grain and the black line is their average, drawn five times too
# large so that it remains visible. Individual grains scatter over many shapes and
# directions. The smooth, slightly flattened average reveals the particle fabric.
#
# `paror` sums the same projection lengths over the grains and divides the curve by its
# maximum. A larger grain contributes a wider projection. Since a sum and a mean differ
# only by the number of grains, this is also the same normalized average drawn above. The
# normalization removes the total scale, so the result compares fabric direction and
# anisotropy, not grain count, phase amount, or mean grain size.
#
# The supplied angle is the axis onto which the vertices are projected. Zero degrees is
# the specimen x axis, angles increase counterclockwise, and the result repeats after 180
# degrees. Sampling through 360 degrees merely closes the polar curve. This is the direct
# form of the traditional description in which a right-handed coordinate system is
# rotated around the particle and the particle is projected onto its x axis.

# ## From boundaries to a surface fabric: SURFOR
#
# `surfor` applies the same projection idea to a list of boundary segments instead of to
# whole grains. It weights every segment by its length and normalizes the summed curve to
# one. Because it needs no closed outline, it also works for selections that are not
# grains: subgrain boundaries, twin boundaries, or contacts between selected phases.
#
# Segment directions inherited from a square pixel grid would dominate this calculation.
# The grains at the start of the page were therefore smoothed before their boundaries
# were selected. Use the same segmentation, spatial resolution, and smoothing procedure
# when comparing maps.

# The four curves differ in both shape and direction. The contact between the two
# pyroxenes, enstatite and diopside, is the roundest, with a minimum at 0.87 of its
# maximum. It is the least anisotropic boundary population in this rock. The most
# anisotropic is the forsterite-diopside contact at 0.68, not the forsterite-forsterite
# boundary at 0.76. What sets the forsterite-forsterite boundary apart is its direction
# rather than its strength: its long direction is 63 degrees, whereas the other three lie
# between 75 and 85 degrees.

# ## Characteristic shape
#
# `characteristicShape` takes every selected boundary segment together with its opposite,
# sorts those vectors by direction, and lays them end to end. They close into a

# an average grain outline, but it is not an observed grain or an arithmetic average
# grain. It represents the selected boundary-length distribution.
