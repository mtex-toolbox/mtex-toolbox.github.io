# # Operations on Orientation-Dependent Functions
#
# The common `SO3Fun` interface lets you calculate with functions much as NumPy calculates
# with arrays. This page starts from two functions and uses them for arithmetic, extrema,
# integration, differentiation and rotation. See
# [Defining Orientation-Dependent Functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunDefinition_py.html) first if the
# representations are unfamiliar.
#
# ## Two Example Functions
#
# The first function is the Dubna ODF determined from neutron diffraction data. An ODF is an
# orientation density function.

# %%
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
SO3F1 = SO3Fun.dubna()
SO3F1

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
plot(SO3F1, 'sigma', sections=4)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The unequal colours show that the measured orientations are not uniformly distributed.
# Several maxima appear across the sigma sections rather than one isolated ideal component.
#
# The second function is a unimodal ODF. It places one radial kernel at the orientation `R`.

# %%
R = orientation.byAxisAngle(vector3d.Y, np.pi / 4, SO3F1.CS)
SO3F2 = SO3FunRBF(R, SO3DeLaValleePoussinKernel())
SO3F2

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
plot(SO3F2, 'sigma', sections=4)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# In contrast to the measured ODF, this plot contains one concentrated component. Its
# appearance in neighbouring sections is the cross-section of one three-dimensional peak in
# orientation space.
#
# ## Arithmetic
#
# Adding functions or scaling them produces another `SO3Fun`. MTEX can combine different
# internal representations in the same expression.

# %%
combined = 2 * SO3F1 + SO3F2
shiftedCombined = 1 + combined
shiftedCombined

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
plot(combined, 'sigma', sections=4)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The combined plot retains features of the measured ODF and adds the narrow component from
# `SO3F2`. The constant in `shiftedCombined` raises every value equally, so it does not
# change the positions of those features.
#
# Basic overloaded operations include `-`, scalar `*`, scalar `/`, pointwise `*`, pointwise
# `/` and pointwise `**`. Pointwise [abs](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.abs.html), [sqrt](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.sqrt.html),
# [conj](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.conj.html), [exp](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.exp.html) and [log](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.log.html) also return
# functions.
#
# ## Pointwise Minimum and Maximum
#
# With two function arguments, [max](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.max.html) and [min](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.min.html) compare
# values independently at every orientation.

# %%
pointwiseMax = max(2 * SO3F1, SO3F2)
plot(pointwiseMax, 'sigma', sections=4)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# At every plotted orientation, the colour comes from whichever input has the larger value.
# The narrow peak survives where it rises above the doubled measured ODF.

# %%
pointwiseMin = min(2 * SO3F1, SO3F2)
plot(pointwiseMin, 'sigma', sections=4)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The minimum keeps the lower input instead. It clips each function wherever the other lies
# below it. Passing one function and one scalar performs the same comparison against a
# constant threshold.
#
# ## Inverting the Argument
#
# The [inv](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.inv.html) operation composes a function with inversion. If `g = inv(f)`,
# then the value of `g` at a rotation is the value of `f` at the inverse rotation.
#
# The check below uses the harmonic representation of the Dubna ODF.

# %%
SO3F1Harmonic = SO3FunHarmonic(SO3F1, bandwidth=16)
g = inv(SO3F1Harmonic)

testRot = rotation(R)
valueAtR = SO3F1Harmonic.eval(testRot)
valueAtR

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
inverseValue = g.eval(inv(testRot))
inverseValue

# %% [markdown]
# The two displayed values agree, which checks the relation $g(\mathbf{R}^{-1}) =
# f(\mathbf{R})$ for this orientation.
#
# ## Global and Local Extrema
#
# The number and type of arguments change what `min` and `max` return.
#
# * With one `SO3Fun`, they return its global extremum and its position.
# * With two functions, they return the pointwise minimum or maximum function shown above.
# * With one function and one scalar, they return a pointwise clipped function.
# * With `numLocal=n`, they return up to `n` distinct local extrema and their positions.
#
# The following search asks for the two largest local maxima of `combined`.

# %%
plot(combined, 'phi2', np.arange(4) * 30 * degree)
mtexColorbar()

maxValue, maxNodes = max(combined, numLocal=2)
annotate(maxNodes)

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
maxValue

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
maxNodes

# %% [markdown]
# The annotations mark the two returned orientations. The first value is the global
# maximum, while the second is the next distinct local maximum.
#
# ## Integration and Norms
#
# [mean](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.mean.html) returns the normalized integral over $SO(3)$. It assigns the
# constant function one an integral of one. [sum](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.sum.html) uses the full
# rotation-group volume $8\pi^2$.

# %%
normalizedIntegral = mean(SO3F1)
normalizedIntegral

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
integralFromSum = sum(SO3F1) / (8 * np.pi ** 2)
integralFromSum

# %% [markdown]
# These two values agree because dividing `sum` by $8\pi^2$ gives the same normalization as
# `mean`.
#
# With this normalized measure, the $L^2$ norm of a function is
#
# $$ \lVert f \rVert_2 = \left( \frac{1}{8\pi^2}
# \int_{SO(3)} \lvert f(\mathbf{R}) \rvert^2\,\mathrm d\mathbf{R}
# \right)^{1/2}. $$
#
# It can be assembled from pointwise operations and `mean`.

# %%
normFromDefinition = sqrt(mean(abs(SO3F1) ** 2))
normFromDefinition

# %% [markdown]
# The dedicated [norm](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.norm.html) command computes the same quantity more
# efficiently. A small difference between the displayed results comes from the numerical
# approximations used by the two routes.

# %%
directNorm = norm(SO3F1)

# ## Differentiation at One Orientation
#
# The gradient at a particular orientation belongs to the tangent space of $SO(3)$ at that
# orientation. MTEX represents it by an [SO3TangentVector](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3TangentVector.SO3TangentVector.html).

# %%
gradientAtR = grad(SO3F1, R)
gradientAtR

# %% [markdown]
# Roughly speaking, this tangent vector points in the direction of steepest ascent.
# Following it through the exponential map produces a new rotation. See
# [Tangent Space Representation on SO(3)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationTangentSpace_py.html) for that construction.
#
# ## The Gradient Field
#
# Without an evaluation orientation, [grad](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.grad.html) returns the gradients at all
# orientations as an `SO3VectorFieldHarmonic`.

# %%
G = grad(SO3F1)
G

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
plot(SO3F1, 'sigma', sections=4)
hold(True)
plot(G, color='black', lineWidth=1, resolution=5 * degree)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The section plot lays down a grey arrow field of its own, and the gradient is drawn in
# black on top of it. Read the black arrows. They are long where the ODF intensity changes
# quickly and almost invisible where it is nearly constant, and each points along the local
# direction of steepest ascent represented in that section.
#
# ## Rotating a Function
#
# [rotate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.rotate.html) moves an orientation-dependent function by a specified
# rotation. This changes where its features occur. It is not a frame change, which would
# re-express the same physical function in a different reference frame.

# %%
rot = rotation.byEuler(30 * degree, 0 * degree, 90 * degree, 'Bunge')
rotated = rotate(SO3FunHarmonic(combined), rot)
rotated

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
plot(rotated, 'sigma', sections=4)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# Compared with the earlier plot of `combined`, the same pattern is shifted through
# orientation space. Its amplitudes and internal arrangement are preserved by the rotation.

#
# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB's `SO3Fun.dubna` is an ODF stored with its specimen frame, whose plotting convention
# is y↓→x, so its plots have Y at the bottom although the page sets y↑→x; the port
# reconstructs the ODF from the pole figures, in the session's frame, and draws Y at the
# top. The reconstruction differs in the digits: the two local maxima are 262.2 and 188.9
# for MATLAB's 262.2 and 187.9, the norm 4.032 for 4.027. MATLAB's page says `inv` of the
# RBF form fails; the port's `inv` works on every form, the page keeps MATLAB's harmonic
# check.
