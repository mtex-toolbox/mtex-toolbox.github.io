# # Fibres in Rotation Space
#
# A fibre is a one-dimensional path through rotation space. A fibre segment joins two
# orientations along their shortest angular path. A full fibre contains every orientation
# that maps one fixed crystal direction onto one fixed specimen direction while leaving the
# rotation about it free.
#
# This page assumes the rotation operations introduced in
# [Calculating with Rotations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationOperations_py.html) and the interpretation of an
# orientation as a map between reference frames from
# [Defining Crystal Orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationDefinition_py.html). Crystal symmetry and
# equivalent orientation descriptions are introduced in
# [Orientation Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationSymmetry_py.html).
#
# The plotting convention controls how the specimen frame is laid out on screen. This page
# uses y north and x east.

# use two reproducible cubic texture components
cs = crystalFrame('432')
oriA = orientation.goss(cs)
oriB = orientation.brass(cs)

# %%
# select the equivalent of oriB nearest to oriA
oriB = oriB.projectIntoFundamentalRegion(oriA)

# %%
# construct the shortest segment between the two representatives
f = fibre(oriA, oriB)
f

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading the Fibre
#
# The displayed endpoint row identifies the finite segment. The row containing `h` and `r`
# gives the crystal and specimen directions that remain aligned along it. The two
# directions live in different reference frames.
#
# The projection above changes only the symmetry-equivalent representative of `oriB`. It
# does not change the physical crystal orientation. Choosing the nearest representative
# makes this endpoint segment the shortest one.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Plotting the Endpoint Segment
#
# The default three-dimensional plot uses Bunge Euler coordinates.

# %%
plot(f, lineWidth=3, lineColor='red')
hold(True)
plot(oriA, 'filled', markerSize=20, markerFaceColor='darkred')
plot(oriB, 'filled', markerSize=20, markerFaceColor='blue')
plt.xlim(0, 90)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading the Endpoint Plot
#
# The red segment joins the dark-red Goss endpoint at $(0,45,0)$ degrees to the blue Brass
# endpoint at $(35,45,0)$ degrees. Only the first Euler angle changes in this example, so
# the segment looks straight. In general, angular distance is not Euclidean distance in an
# Euler coordinate plot.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Two Directions That Define a Fibre
#
# An orientation maps a direction from the crystal frame into the specimen frame. Every
# orientation `ori` on the full fibre satisfies
#
# $$ \mathtt{ori} * h = r. $$
#
# The endpoint constructor has already computed these directions. They are available as
# the `h` and `r` properties of [fibre](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/fibre.fibre.html).

# %%
h = f.h
h

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
r = f.r
r

# %% [markdown]
# Both endpoints map `h` exactly onto `r`. The two displayed entries are their mapping
# errors in degrees.

# %%
mappingErrorDegrees = np.array([angle(oriA * h, r), angle(oriB * h, r)]) / degree
mappingErrorDegrees

# %% [markdown]
# ## A Full Fibre
#
# The option `full=True` discards the finite endpoint and continues the curve through
# every rotation about the aligned direction.

# %%
fullFibre = fibre(oriA, oriB, full=True)
fullFibre

# %% [markdown]
# A crystal--specimen direction pair constructs the same full fibre directly. The
# displayed logical value confirms that the two definitions agree.

# %%
directionFibre = fibre(h, r)
sameFullFibre = fullFibre == directionFibre
sameFullFibre

# %% [markdown]
# ## Symmetry Can Split the Plot
#
# By default, an orientation plot is folded into a fundamental region.

# %%
plot(fullFibre, 'axisAngle', lineWidth=3, lineColor='red')
plt.gca().set_axis_off()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading the Symmetry-Reduced Plot
#
# The red fibre appears as disconnected arcs because it leaves the chosen fundamental
# region and re-enters through a symmetry-equivalent face. These arcs belong to one fibre,
# not to several different fibres.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Complete Axis--Angle Domain
#
# The option `'complete'` removes the reduction by crystal symmetry.

# %%
plot(fullFibre, 'axisAngle', 'complete', lineWidth=3, lineColor='red')
plt.gca().set_axis_off()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading the Complete Plot
#
# The complete axis--angle ball exposes more of the red curve without the cubic
# fundamental-region faces. It still has a coordinate seam: opposite points on the outer
# sphere describe the same half turn. A curve cut at that seam is therefore still one
# closed fibre in rotation space.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Sampling a Fibre
#
# [orientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/fibre.orientation.html) discretises a fibre for plotting or numerical
# calculations. Specify the number of samples when it matters.

# %%
sampledOri = orientation(f, points=12)
numberOfSamples = len(sampledOri)
numberOfSamples

# %% [markdown]
# The markers show the 12 sampled orientations on the finite endpoint segment. The
# continuous red curve remains the underlying fibre.

# %%
plot(f, lineWidth=2, lineColor='red')
plt.xlim(0, 90)
hold(True)
plot(sampledOri, markerSize=8, markerEdgeColor='darkblue', lineWidth=2)
hold(False)

# ## Why a Full Fibre Is a Circle
#
# Unit quaternions represent rotations with the identification $q=-q$. Starting from a
# quaternion $q_0$, a spin through the angle $\omega$ about the aligned direction traces
#
# $$ q(\omega)=\left(\cos\frac{\omega}{2}, \sin\frac{\omega}{2}\,\mathbf{n}\right)q_0. $$
#
# As $\omega$ runs from 0 to $2\pi$, this path follows half of a great circle on the unit
# 3-sphere from $q_0$ to $-q_0$. Those endpoints represent the same rotation, so their
# projection into rotation space is a closed circle. The finite fibre constructed first is
# one subarc of this circle.

# ## Where Fibres Reappear in MTEX
#
# [angle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/fibre.angle.html) measures the distance from an orientation to a fibre.
# [Fibres of Orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFibre_py.html) develops pole-figure and
# inverse-pole-figure plots, symmetrisation, and named rolling-texture fibres.
# [Fibre ODFs](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/FibreODFs_py.html) spreads a density around a fibre.
#
# Pole-figure values integrate an ODF over fibres. This integration is the
# crystallographic Radon transform developed in the
# [pole figure tutorial](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureTutorial_py.html).

# ## Technical Details
#
# A fibre stores its two orientations and the aligned direction; `h`, `r` and the arc are
# derived. `full=True` is MATLAB's `'full'` flag, `orientation(f, points=12)` samples it.
