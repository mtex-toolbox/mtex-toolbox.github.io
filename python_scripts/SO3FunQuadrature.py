# # Quadrature of Orientation-Dependent Functions
#
# The preceding interpolation pages start from observations at fixed orientations.
# Quadrature addresses a different problem: the function can be evaluated at orientations
# chosen by MTEX. Those evaluations may come from an `SO3Fun`, a Python function, a
# simulation, or a physical experiment that can be queried at prescribed orientations.
#
# MTEX chooses a grid of orientations and matching integration weights. It then converts the
# evaluated values into the Fourier coefficients of an
# [SO3FunHarmonic](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunHarmonicRepresentation_py.html). This page shows the one-command route
# and the explicit grid--evaluate--quadrature sequence.

# ## Approximate a known function
#
# Use the Dubna orientation distribution function (ODF) as the evaluator. An ODF is a
# nonnegative orientation-dependent density with mean 1.
#
# The [SO3FunHarmonic](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunHarmonic.SO3FunHarmonic.html) constructor falls back on
# [SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature.html) only when its input has no
# faster route of its own. The Dubna ODF is an `SO3FunRBF`, which builds its coefficients
# from its centres and kernel, so no quadrature grid is used in the call below. The explicit
# sequence later on this page takes the quadrature route.
#
# The bandwidth is the largest harmonic degree retained in the result. Bandwidth 14 is
# deliberately lower than the bandwidth of the supplied ODF, so this first conversion is an
# approximation rather than exact recovery.

#
# Gauss--Legendre uses fewer nodes in the second Euler angle. It therefore needs about half

# external evaluation is expensive.

# For this bandwidth and symmetry, the printed counts of distinct nodes are 4060 for
# Clenshaw--Curtis and 2250 for Gauss--Legendre. Thus Gauss--Legendre uses 55 percent as many
# external evaluations. Both recover the reference to the numerical accuracy of the
# transforms, and their difference is of the same small order.
#
# Both rules are exact, up to numerical transform accuracy, for rotational harmonic
# functions whose bandwidth does not exceed the grid bandwidth. They need not return the same
# truncation of a function containing higher degrees. This distinction is why the example
# tests exactness with `reference` rather than directly with the bandwidth-48 `odf`.
#
# ## When the orientations cannot be chosen
#
# Quadrature is not appropriate when an instrument has already fixed the sample
# orientations. Random orientations do not become a quadrature rule merely because there are
# many of them. Use [interpolation from discrete data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunApproximationTheory_py.html) in
# that case.
#
# If an external experiment can be run at arbitrary orientations, the quadrature grid is the
# optimal structured choice for a harmonic result. If an RBF result is required instead,
# evaluate an [equispacedSO3Grid](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/equispacedSO3Grid.html) and pass the resulting
# orientation--value pairs to [SO3FunRBF.interpolate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunRBF.interpolate.html).
#
# ## Quadrature is not RBF fitting
#
# [RBF-Kernel Interpolation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RBFApproximationTheory_py.html) develops the RBF workflow in full.
# An [SO3FunRBF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunRBF.SO3FunRBF.html) represents a function as a weighted sum of
# rotational kernels centred at chosen orientations. Its spatial method chooses the
# coefficients by minimizing pointwise error at an evaluation grid. LSQR is the default
# unconstrained solver. Although stationarity can be expressed through the normal equations,
# LSQR does not form those equations explicitly.
#
# The `density` flag selects modified least squares, `mlsq`. It constrains the weights to be
# nonnegative, and MTEX normalizes the result to mean 1. The commands `min(F)` and `mean(F)`
# check these two density properties after a fit.
#
# These constructor forms summarize the choices described on the RBF page:
#
# ```python
# F = SO3FunRBF(odfHarmonic, density=True)
# F = SO3FunRBF(odfHarmonic, halfwidth=5 * degree, resolution=10 * degree)
# psi = SO3AbelPoissonKernel(halfwidth=5 * degree)
# centres = orientation.rand(1000, odfHarmonic.CS)
# F = SO3FunRBF(odfHarmonic, kernel=psi, SO3Grid=centres)
# F = SO3FunRBF(odfHarmonic, halfwidth=5 * degree, approxresolution=5 * degree)
# ```
#
# `kernel` or `halfwidth` chooses the radial kernel. `SO3Grid` supplies its centres, while
# `resolution` constructs a centre grid. `approxresolution` controls the separate grid on
# which the input function is evaluated. Use `calcError(odfHarmonic, F)` to compare a fitted
# representation with its source.
#
# ## Spatial and harmonic RBF errors
#
# The default RBF method minimizes pointwise error between the source $f$ and the RBF model
# $g$ at evaluation orientations $x_m$:
#
# $$ \sum_{m=1}^M \lvert f(x_m)-g(x_m)\rvert^2. $$
#
# The `harmonic` flag instead chooses the kernel weights so that the Fourier coefficients of
# $f$ and $g$ are close. It minimizes
#
# $$ \sum_{n=0}^N\sum_{k,l=-n}^n
# \lvert\hat f_n^{k,l}-\hat g_n^{k,l}\rvert^2. $$
#
# The spatial method is usually better suited to sharp, high-bandwidth functions. The
# harmonic system is better suited to low bandwidth because its matrix grows quickly with the
# number of Fourier coefficients. Select it with `SO3FunRBF(odfHarmonic, harmonic=True)`.
#
# Both `lsqr` and `mlsq` stop according to `tol` and `maxIter`. Their default tolerance is
# `1e-3`. Unconstrained `lsqr` uses at most 30 iterations, whereas `mlsq` uses at most 100.
# Tighten these settings only when a validation error or a physical conclusion requires it.
#
# ## The maths behind quadrature
#
# A band-limited rotational function is a finite series of
# [Wigner-D functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/WignerFunctions_py.html):
#
# $$ f(R)=\sum_{n=0}^N\sum_{k,l=-n}^n
# \hat f_n^{k,l}D_n^{k,l}(R). $$
#
# Its Fourier coefficients are integrals over orientation space with the normalized Haar
# measure $\mu$:
#
# $$ \hat f_n^{k,l}=\int_{\mathrm{SO}(3)} f(R)\,
# \overline{D_n^{k,l}(R)}\,\mathrm{d}\mu(R). $$
#
# A quadrature rule replaces each integral by values at nodes $R_m$ and prescribed weights
# $\omega_m$:
#
# $$ \hat f_n^{k,l}\approx\sum_{m=1}^M \omega_m f(R_m)
# \overline{D_n^{k,l}(R_m)}. $$
#
# The weights are part of the rule. Treating all structured nodes equally, or substituting
# arbitrary random orientations, changes the integral. MTEX combines periodic quadrature in
# the first and third Euler angles with either Clenshaw--Curtis or Gauss--Legendre nodes in
# the second angle.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB's `numel(grid)` and `grid(:)` are `grid.size` and `grid.flatten()`. The port merges
# every pair of nodes that are one orientation under the symmetries, 4060 and 2250 distinct
# nodes where MATLAB counts 4500 and 2400; the full grids of 8700 and 4500 nodes agree. The
# recovery errors are 4e-9 and 6e-9 for MATLAB's 4e-8 and 7e-8, the approximation error
# 0.2003 for MATLAB's 0.1996 from the reconstruction of the Dubna ODF.
