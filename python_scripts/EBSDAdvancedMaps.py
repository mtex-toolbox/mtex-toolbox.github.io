# # Advanced Color Keys
#
# An orientation colour key maps orientation space to RGB colour space. Ideally, that map
# would have five properties:
#
# 1. symmetrically equivalent orientations have the same colour
# 2. similar orientations have similar colours
# 3. different orientations have different colours
# 4. the whole colour space is used, for full contrast
# 5. if the data occupies only a small part of orientation space, the whole colour space
#    is spent on that part
#
# No key has all five. Orientation space is curved and contains symmetry, whereas RGB
# colour space is a box, so continuity, uniqueness, and contrast cannot all be preserved.
# A colour edge may therefore come from the key rather than from the specimen.
#
# The right compromise depends on the question. MTEX provides
#
# * [ipfHSVKey](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ipfHSVKey.html), the default MTEX inverse pole figure key
# * [ipfTSLKey](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ipfTSLKey.html) and [ipfHKLKey](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ipfHKLKey.html), for maps compatible with
#   other EBSD systems
# * [BungeColorKey](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BungeColorKey.html), which maps Euler angles to RGB
# * `PatalaColorKey`, for the grain-boundary misorientations demonstrated in
#   [Grain Boundary Plots](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryPlots_py.html); it is not ported yet
# * [axisAngleColorKey](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/axisAngleColorKey.html), for deviations from a reference
#   orientation
# * [spotColorKey](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spotColorKey.html) and [ipfSpotKey](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ipfSpotKey.html), for highlighting
#   chosen orientations or fibres
#
# [IPF Maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html) develops the first three keys.
# [Sharp Color Keys](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSharpPlot_py.html) covers `axisAngleColorKey` and the fifth
# property above. This page compares Euler colouring with spot keys.
#
# The examples assume that the data has been [imported](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDImport_py.html), its
# [specimen reference frame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) has been checked, and basic
# [EBSD plotting](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDPlotting_py.html) is familiar.

# ## Euler angle colouring
#
# The Bunge key scales the three Euler angles over their fundamental ranges and uses them
# as the red, green, and blue channels. It retains a three-parameter description of
# orientation, but Euler-angle wrapping makes nearby orientations jump between distant
# colours.

# %%
colorKey = BungeColorKey(ebsd['Fo'])

plot(ebsd['fo'], colorKey.orientation2color(ebsd['fo'].orientations))

# %% [markdown]
# Individual grains appear as flat, well-separated colours. This makes the map look
# decisive, but it does not reveal where the colour scale wraps. Plotting the key in its
# default sections also looks deceptively smooth.

# %%
plot(colorKey)

# %% [markdown]
# [Sigma sections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SigmaSections_py.html) cut orientation space at constant
# $\sigma = \varphi_1-\varphi_2$. They expose the seams hidden by the default view.

# %%
plot(colorKey, 'sigma', sections=6)

# %% [markdown]
# Along several section edges the colour changes abruptly although the orientations
# remain close. Two nearly identical grains can therefore be drawn in unrelated colours.
# Treat such a colour edge as a property of the key until another measurement or map
# confirms a physical boundary.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Marking one orientation
#
# A different question is where the map lies near one chosen orientation. A
# `spotColorKey` gives the centre its chosen colour and fades towards white with
# increasing disorientation.

# %%
colorKey = spotColorKey(ebsd['Fo'])
colorKey.center = mean(ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations, robust=True)
colorKey.color = [0, 0, 1]

plot(ebsd['fo'], colorKey.orientation2color(ebsd['fo'].orientations))

# plot the corresponding key in orientation space
plot(colorKey, 'sigma', sections=9)

# %% [markdown]
# Blue marks orientations near the robust mean, and white marks orientations far from
# it. The corresponding key shows that this is a three-dimensional neighbourhood in
# orientation space, not a range on a single Euler angle.
#
# The 20° halfwidth is where the kernel, and hence the blue saturation, falls to half its
# value at the centre. The fade has no hard edge. To count a specified neighbourhood, use
# [volume](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.volume.html) with an explicit radius.

# %%
spotPercent = 100 * volume(ebsd['fo'].orientations, colorKey.center, 20 * degree)
spotPercent

# %% [markdown]
# 12.1% of the indexed forsterite measurements lie within 20° of the robust mean. Because
# this equally spaced map gives every measurement the same weight, the result is an
# area-weighted measurement fraction, not a bulk specimen volume fraction.
#
# A density estimate asks a related but different question. It replaces each measurement
# by a kernel and adds the kernels, so the result depends on the chosen 10° halfwidth.

# %%
odf = calcDensity(ebsd['fo'].orientations, halfwidth=10 * degree)

mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The density plot contains a pronounced maximum in the same part of orientation space
# as the blue spot. It corroborates the concentration, but its peak height is a density
# rather than the percentage printed above. [ODF Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD2ODF_py.html) explains the
# weighting and bandwidth choices.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Marking a fibre
#
# An [orientation fibre](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFibre_py.html) is the set of all orientations that map
# one crystal direction `h` onto one specimen direction `r`. Rotation about `r` remains
# free, so a fibre is a one-dimensional family rather than one orientation.

# %%
# define the fibre with the crystal (111) pole parallel to the specimen normal
f = fibre(Miller(1, 1, 1, csFo), zvector)

# colour directions near the fibre
colorKey = ipfSpotKey(csFo)
colorKey.ipfDirection = f.r
colorKey.center = f.h
colorKey.color = [0, 0, 1]
colorKey.psi = S2DeLaValleePoussinKernel(halfwidth=7.5 * degree)

plot(ebsd['fo'], colorKey.orientation2color(ebsd['fo'].orientations))

# %% [markdown]
# The blue grains have their crystal $(111)$ pole near the specimen normal. This key
# measures angular distance in the inverse pole figure, so it ignores the free rotation
# about the normal exactly as the fibre does.

# %%
plot(colorKey)

circle(f.h.projectIntoFundamentalRegion(), 15 * degree, lineWidth=2)

# %% [markdown]
# The kernel halfwidth is 7.5°, where the blue saturation has fallen by half. The circle
# is deliberately larger: it marks the 15° radius used for the hard count below. The
# colour continues to fade outside the circle.

# 24.8% of the indexed forsterite measurements have their $(111)$ pole within 15° of the
# specimen normal. The black dots are a random sample of the measured inverse pole figure
# directions.
#
# The circle covers 13.5% of the fundamental sector, so 24.8% of the measurements inside
# it is an enrichment of 1.8 times. That enrichment is what the count reports. Smoothed
# with the same 7.5° kernel the blue centre reaches 1.8 mrd, while the maximum of the
# sector, 3.4 mrd, lies about 20° away and outside the circle. A fibre count therefore
# answers how much of the map lies near the chosen direction, and leaves the question of
# which direction is preferred to a density.

# ## Marking several fibres
#
# Several crystal directions can be highlighted at once. Each centre needs one RGB row in
# `colorKey.color`.

# %% [markdown]
# The key contains six coloured lobes, and the black measurements show which lobes the
# data occupies. This is not a nearest-centre classification. Every centre contributes
# its fading kernel, so nearby lobes blend where they overlap and orientations far from
# all centres remain pale.

# The map now locates six fibre components at once. Compare a pixel with the key to
# identify the contributing crystal direction; do not read the colour as a complete
# orientation.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Combining two maps in one figure
#
# A highlighted component is easier to place when the microstructure remains visible
# underneath it. Draw band contrast first, then add the spot colours with the
# [faceAlpha](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.plot.html) option.

# Blue locates the forsterite measurements near the selected fibre. The grey
# band-contrast layer keeps boundaries and pattern-quality structure visible.
# Transparency changes only the rendering; it does not change the EBSD data or the
# angular selection.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Choosing the key
#
# Use a Bunge key only when retaining all three Euler parameters matters, and check its
# seams before interpreting a colour edge. Use a spot key to locate one orientation and
# an IPF spot key to locate a fibre. Use `volume` for a hard angular count and an ODF for
# a smoothed density estimate.
#
# Small intragranular changes need a reference-based key rather than a global one;
# [Sharp Color Keys](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSharpPlot_py.html) develops that case. The following pages turn
# from display to measurements of local lattice rotation: [KAM](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDKAM_py.html) compares
# neighbouring pixels, while [Mis2Mean / GROD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGROD_py.html) compares each pixel with
# its grain reference orientation.
