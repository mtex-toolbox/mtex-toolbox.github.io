# # Grain Reference Orientation Deviation (GROD)
#
# The grain reference orientation deviation asks how far each measurement has turned
# away from a chosen orientation for its own grain. The grain mean is the usual
# reference.
#
# [KAM](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDKAM_py.html) compares a point with its immediate neighbours and asks how
# sharply the lattice is bent. GROD instead compares the point with the grain reference.
# It reveals orientation variation across the whole grain. GROD records lattice rotation
# relative to that reference. It is not a strain measurement or a measure of accumulated
# deformation.
#
# Both the angle and the axis of the deviation carry information. The angle shows its
# magnitude, while the axis can distinguish rotation patterns that the angle alone hides.
#
# The example is a deformed ferrite specimen. The misorientation axes are very sensitive
# to noise, so the orientations are denoised first. See [Denoising](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDDenoising_py.html).
#
# The page assumes that the map has already been segmented into grains. See
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) for that step. Misorientation angle
# and axis should also be familiar; see [Misorientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html).

# ## The deviation angle
#
# [calcGROD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcGROD.html) computes the deviation as a misorientation, one per
# measurement. It needs the reconstructed grains as a second argument. It also needs
# `ebsd.grainId`, which `calcGrains` set.

# %% [markdown]
# Half the measurements are within about 1.6° of their grain mean and the worst reach
# about 19°. The large values are not scattered. They fill extended parts of grains and
# often end at the inner boundaries.
#
# Those boundaries were detected from local neighbour misorientations, not from GROD. A
# [subgrain boundary](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SubGrainBoundaries_py.html) can coincide with a jump in GROD, but a
# GROD jump is not its definition.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Grain orientation spread
#
# Averaging the deviation angle over each grain gives the grain orientation spread.
# [grainMean](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.grainMean.html) performs that averaging.
#
# Although `calcGrains` stored `grains.GOS`, that value belongs to the raw orientations.
# The calculation below deliberately uses the denoised data.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# Of the 377 grains the median spread is below a degree and the largest 6.6°. The map is
# not uniform. Some grains have much more internal orientation variation than their
# neighbours, producing an order-of-magnitude spread.
#
# GOS depends on segmentation, denoising, reference orientation, and grain size.
# Comparisons require the same choices.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The misorientation axis in crystal coordinates
#
# Every deviation also has an axis, and it matters in which reference frame that axis is
# expressed. The crystal frame is attached to the lattice of the phase. In this frame the
# axis is an $(hk\ell)$ crystal direction, obtained with [axis](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.axis.html).

# %% [markdown]
# The range is close to uniform, about 0.8 to 1.2 times. In crystal coordinates the axes
# are therefore close to evenly distributed, with a slight preference for $[101]$. A
# colour key shows where those directions occur in the map.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# Directions related by ferrite crystal symmetry have the same colour in this key. The
# deviation angle serves as transparency in the map below, so that points which have
# barely turned fade to white.
#
# A small-angle axis is poorly constrained by conventional EBSD. Whitening it prevents
# uncertain axes from dominating the picture, but it is a visualization choice rather
# than an uncertainty correction.

# Whole regions of a grain share one colour, that is one misorientation axis. This is
# what makes the crystal frame worth looking at.
#
# A low-angle boundary formed by a single slip system has its axis fixed by the geometry
# of that system. A pure tilt wall turns about an axis in the slip plane and
# perpendicular to the Burgers vector. A pure twist wall turns about the slip plane
# normal. This rule applies directly to the misorientation across a boundary. GROD
# compares a point with its reference.
#
# A coherent GROD-axis cluster can nevertheless constrain candidate slip systems when
# combined with the angle map and independent slip geometry. V. Tong, E. Wielewski and
# B. Britton use long-range rotations in
# [Characterisation of Slip and Twinning in High-Rate-Deformed Zirconium with EBSD](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1803.00236).
#
# A cluster alone does not identify a unique active system. The
# [slip system](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SlipSystems_py.html) and [dislocation system](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DislocationSystems_py.html)
# chapters describe how to set up candidates in MTEX. See

# itself.

# ## The misorientation axis in specimen coordinates
#
# The specimen frame is the reference frame in which the map and sample are expressed.
# The same axis in this frame is the crystal axis carried over by the orientation of the
# measurement.
#
# The option `symmetry=False` is essential. The axis must be the representative that belongs
# to this orientation, not a symmetric equivalent.

# %% [markdown]
# This distribution runs from about 0.2 to nearly 7 times uniform. The same axes that
# were spread evenly over the crystal are strongly clustered in the specimen frame.
# Loading is defined in this frame, which makes the clustering useful. Texture and a few
# highly deformed grains can also produce maxima; the map below distinguishes those
# possibilities.
#
# In the specimen frame the axes have no crystal symmetry and are directional rather
# than antipodal. The colour key therefore uses the whole sphere.

# ## Choosing another reference orientation
#
# The grain mean is convenient, but it removes a rigid rotation shared by the whole
# grain. [calcGROD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcGROD.html) accepts a third argument: one reference rotation
# for every grain ID, or one scalar for all grains.
#
# A registered map of the undeformed specimen can supply one initial orientation per
# grain. GROD then retains whole-grain rotation relative to that state. Such a comparison
# first requires spatial registration; see
# [TrueEBSD Distortion Correction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDTrueEbsd_py.html). Changing the reference changes
# the angle, axis, and GOS. State that choice in every reported method.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The definition
#
# For the orientation $o_{i,j}$ at position $(i,j)$ and the chosen reference orientation
# $r_g$ of its grain,
#
# $$\mathrm{GROD}_{i,j} = \mathbf S_{i,j} \cdot \mathrm{inv}(r_g) \cdot o_{i,j}$$
#
# where the symmetry element $\mathbf S_{i,j}$ is the one that makes the misorientation
# angle as small as possible. With no third input to `calcGROD`, $r_g$ is the grain mean
# orientation.
