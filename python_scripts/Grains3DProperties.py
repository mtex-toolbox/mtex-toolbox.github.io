# # Properties of Three-Dimensional Grains
#
# [Three-Dimensional Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3D_py.html) defines the `grain3d` collection and its
# polyhedral representation. Three-dimensional grains retain material properties such as
# `meanOrientation`, but their size and shape require volume and surface measures rather
# than planar area and perimeter.
#
# Start with size: how much material belongs to the large grains? Then distinguish
# elongated grains from compact ones, and identify shapes cut short by the measurement
# boundary. These questions need different measures and different statistical weights.

# ## Load the example microstructure
#
# The bundled data set is a Neper tessellation. The previous
# [Neper Interface](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/NeperInterface_py.html) page explains how such a collection is generated
# or imported. Loading the existing file needs no Neper installation. Its lengths are
# expressed in the tessellation coordinate units; assign a physical scale before comparing
# with an experiment.

# assign trigonal quartz symmetry, as on the Neper Interface page

# Each colour represents one mean orientation. The faceted outlines are the boundary
# polygons from which the geometric properties are computed.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Compare size measures
#
# Diameter, surface area, and volume answer different questions. The diameter spans the
# two most distant vertices. Surface sums the areas of all faces, while volume measures the
# enclosed polyhedron. Their units follow the mesh coordinates: length, length squared, and
# length cubed. A tessellation has no experimental length calibration merely because it
# can be plotted.
#
# Select by grain id so the choice remains meaningful after subsetting.

# %%
grainId = 9
grain = grains['id', grainId]

# %%

# %%
print(grain.volume)

# %% [markdown]
# Equal volumes need not mean equal elongation or equal surface area. The
# equivalent-sphere diameter provides a size measure independent of surface roughness;
# sphericity compares the measured surface with that of a sphere enclosing the same
# volume. A sphere has sphericity one.

# %%
equivalentDiameter = (6 * grains.volume / np.pi) ** (1 / 3)
sphericity = (36 * np.pi) ** (1 / 3) * grains.volume ** (2 / 3) / grains.surface()

# %% [markdown]
# Face and neighbourhood counts provide complementary structural measures.

# %%
print(np.r_[grain.numFaces, grain.numNeighbors])

# %% [markdown]
# A triangulated interface can contain many mesh faces but still separate only two
# grains. `numFaces` depends on the mesh; `numNeighbors` describes grain connectivity. A
# face on the outside has no neighbouring grain.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Which grains are completely inside the measurement?
#
# A grain meeting the measurement hull is truncated: its measured volume is only the part
# inside the box. The zero grain id identifies the exterior and lets us find these grains
# without relying on a bounding-box tolerance. Make this selection on the full collection,
# before selecting a phase.

# %%
gB = grains.boundary
hullIds = np.unique(gB.grainId[np.any(gB.grainId == 0, axis=1)])
isInterior = ~np.isin(grains.id, hullIds)
print([len(grains), np.count_nonzero(isInterior)])

# %% [markdown]
# Interior grains have complete measured shapes. Excluding hull grains also preferentially
# excludes large grains, which are more likely to meet the box. Report the selection with a
# size distribution. Below we retain the whole synthetic tessellation so that the two
# weightings use the same set.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Number-weighted and volume-weighted distributions
#
# A plain numeric histogram gives every grain one count. This answers how many grains
# fall in a size interval. `histogram(grains, ...)` weights each grain by its volume and
# reports relative volume in percent. For questions about the fraction of material in an
# interval, this is the more realistic view.

# %%

plt.xlabel('grain volume (length units$^3$)')
plt.ylabel('number of grains')

histogram(grains, grains.volume, volumeEdges)
mtexTitle('Volume weighted')

# %% [markdown]
# Large grains are relatively inconspicuous in the count histogram but gain weight in the
# second panel. Neither weighting is universally preferable; the denominator must match the
# scientific question.
#
# The same distinction applies to any other property. Here the horizontal coordinate is
# surface area, while the weight remains grain volume.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# The right panel asks what fraction of the total material belongs to grains in each
# surface-area interval. It does not show a surface-area fraction.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Relate diameter and volume
#
# A scatter plot tests how two measures covary. Taking the cube root of volume puts both
# axes in units of length. Similar grain shapes should lie near a common trend; elongated
# or irregular grains can depart from it.

# %%
plt.figure()
plt.scatter(grains.volume ** (1 / 3), grains.diameter, 18, grains.color)
plt.xlabel('cube root of volume (length units)')
plt.ylabel('diameter (length units)')

# %% [markdown]
# The overall increase confirms that larger volumes usually have larger diameters. The
# vertical spread at a fixed cube-root volume records shape variation rather than a change
# of units.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Ellipsoid-based shape
#
# `principalComponents` computes three orthogonal vectors `a`, `b`, and `c` from the
# grain's volume moments. Their directions are the principal directions, and their lengths
# are the half-axes of an ellipsoid scaled to the same volume as the grain.
# `plotEllipsoid` draws them.

# %%
a, b, c = grains.principalComponents()

# compute one IPF colour for each ellipsoid
cKey = ipfColorKey(grains.CS)
color = cKey.orientation2color(grains.meanOrientation)

newMtexFigure()
plotEllipsoid(grains.centroid, a, b, c, faceColor=color)
setCamera(plottingConvention.default3D)

# %% [markdown]
# The ellipsoids preserve centroid, principal directions, and volume, while discarding
# individual facets. Long thin ellipsoids therefore identify anisotropic shape without
# reproducing every boundary face.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Is shape anisotropy associated with grain size?
#
# The ratio of the longest to the shortest ellipsoid half-axis separates elongation from
# size. Colouring by sphericity adds a surface measure: grains can have similar aspect
# ratios yet differ in how faceted they are.

# %%
axisLengths = np.column_stack([norm(a), norm(b), norm(c)])
aspectRatio = axisLengths.max(axis=1) / axisLengths.min(axis=1)
plt.figure()
h = plt.scatter(equivalentDiameter, aspectRatio, 24, sphericity)
plt.xlabel('equivalent-sphere diameter (length units)')
plt.ylabel('longest / shortest principal half-axis')
plt.colorbar(h, label='sphericity')

# %% [markdown]
# The ellipsoid reduces each grain to a few shape descriptors. It cannot resolve narrow
# necks or individual facets. For voxel reconstructions,
# [compare smoothing choices](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DSmoothing_py.html) before interpreting sphericity,
# because staircase surfaces inflate the denominator.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Vertices and three kinds of centre
#
# `grain.V` contains the vertices used by the selected grain. Its `centroid` is the centre
# of the enclosed volume. Each entry of `grain.boundary` is one face, and
# `grain.boundary.centroid` contains one area centroid per face.

# %%
grain = grains['id', 5]

plot(grain, faceAlpha=0.5, edgeAlpha=0.2, micronbar='off')
hold(True)
plot(grain.centroid)
plot(grain.V)
plot(grain.boundary.centroid)
hold(False)
setCamera(plottingConvention.default3D)

# %% [markdown]
# The single interior marker is the volume centroid. Vertex markers lie on polygon corners,
# while the face-centroid markers lie within the boundary faces. These point sets describe
# different levels of the same geometry.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Whole-grain property reference
#
# The main whole-grain properties are
#
# | Property | Purpose | Property | Purpose |
# | --- | --- | --- | --- |
# | `volume` | enclosed volume | `surface` | enclosing surface area |
# | `diameter` | largest vertex-to-vertex distance | `principalComponents` | volume-matched ellipsoid half-axes |
# | `centroid` | volume centroid | `V` | grain vertices |
# | `numPixel` | voxel count after reconstruction | `numFaces` | number of mesh faces |
# | `numNeighbors` | number of neighbouring grains | `boundary` | enclosing boundary faces |
#
# Several `grain2d` shape properties do not yet have three-dimensional counterparts:
# `caliper`, `equivalentRadius`, `equivalentPerimeter`, `shapeFactor`, `isBoundary`,
# `hasHole`, and `isInclusion`.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Boundary-face properties
#
# A three-dimensional grain boundary stores one entry per polygonal face. Its principal
# geometric and crystallographic properties are
#
# | Property | Purpose | Property | Purpose |
# | --- | --- | --- | --- |
# | `area` | face area (length squared) | `N` | stored normal direction |
# | `diameter` | largest vertex-to-vertex distance | `perimeter` | length around the face |
# | `centroid` | area centroid | `grainId` | ids of adjacent grains |
# | `misorientation` | orientation difference across the face | `ebsdId` | adjacent voxel ids after reconstruction |
#
# The stored normal has one direction for a shared face. The
# [outward-normal example](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3D_py.html) explains how `I_GF` changes that sign for one
# chosen grain. Here `antipodal=True` deliberately treats opposite normal directions as
# equivalent and emphasizes the boundary-plane axes.

# %%
hold(True)
quiver(grain.boundary, grain.boundary.N, antipodal=True, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The arrows are normal to the faces on which they start. Because they are plotted
# antipodally, this figure does not claim that every arrow points outwards.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Misorientation across indexed faces
#
# An indexed face separates two grains whose mean orientations are known. Filtering with
# `'indexed'` excludes faces for which that crystallographic comparison is unavailable.
# The colour below is the misorientation angle across each remaining face. In this
# tessellation it comes from grain mean orientations; a voxel reconstruction instead stores
# the difference between the neighbouring voxel orientations.

# %%
indexedBoundary = grains.boundary['indexed']
plot(indexedBoundary, indexedBoundary.misorientation.angle() / degree, micronbar='off', edgeAlpha=0.1)
setCamera(plottingConvention.default3D)
mtexColorbar(location='southoutside', title='misorientation angle (degrees)')

# %% [markdown]
# Faces with similar colours separate grain pairs with similar misorientation angles. The
# colour does not encode face orientation or face area, which are the separate properties
# `N` and `area`.

# ## Technical details
#
# `surface` is a method, `grains.surface()`, as `principalComponents` is; MATLAB's
# `[a, b, c] = principalComponents(grains)` is `a, b, c = grains.principalComponents()`.
# The ellipsoids are drawn on a grid of 24 by 12 rather than MATLAB's 50 by 20, which keeps
# the interactive page of a thousand ellipsoids small. MATLAB's plain `histogram`,
# `scatter` and `colorbar` are matplotlib's.
