# # EBSD Orientation Analysis
#
# An EBSD map couples every measured orientation to a position. This page deliberately
# discards those positions and asks a texture question: does this rock have a fibre
# texture? The example begins with a plausible but incomplete answer, then tests it in
# all three dimensions of orientation space.
#
# The page assumes phase selection from [Select EBSD Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSelect_py.html) and the pole
# and inverse pole figures introduced in [Orientation Plots](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDOrientationPlots_py.html).
# A *reference frame* is the coordinate system in which the data are expressed. Check it
# as described in [Reference Frame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) before interpreting any
# specimen direction.
#
# A *plotting convention* states how that frame is laid out on screen. The convention
# below draws specimen Y upward and specimen X to the right. It changes only the screen
# layout, not the measured orientations.

# The phase map establishes the spatial context: forsterite occupies most of the indexed
# area and occurs in a modest number of large grains. No position is used below. This
# dense scan therefore contributes many similar orientations from each large grain, a
# weighting issue revisited at the end of the page. For analysis that retains position,
# see [Profiles](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDProfile_py.html).

# ## A first look at the pole figures
#
# A pole figure fixes a crystal direction and shows where it points in the specimen. Plot
# the density of the three principal forsterite poles.

# %%
# crystal symmetry of the forsterite phase
cs = ebsd['Forsterite'].CS
h = cat(Miller(1, 0, 0, cs), Miller(0, 1, 0, cs), Miller(0, 0, 1, cs))
plotPF(ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations, h, antipodal=True, smooth=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The $(100)$ density forms a *girdle*, a band along a great circle, rather than one
# compact spot. A fibre texture can produce this pattern: all crystals share one
# direction and are otherwise free to turn about it. A single pole figure discards that
# free rotation, however, so the girdle is a hypothesis rather than proof of a fibre
# texture.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Finding the specimen axis
#
# If the $(100)$ poles lie on a great circle, there is a specimen axis orthogonal to all
# of them. [perp](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.perp.html) finds the axis that is closest to being orthogonal
# to the measured poles in a least-squares sense.

# %%
# orientations of the forsterite phase
ori = ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations

# specimen vectors in the 100 pole figure
r = ori * Miller(1, 0, 0, ori.CS)

# specimen axis best orthogonal to the pole vectors
rOrth = perp(r)
rOrth

# %%
plot(rOrth, add2all=True, marker='square', markerFaceColor='DarkRed')

# %% [markdown]
# The displayed result is an antipodal axis: either sign is the same normal to the girdle
# plane. The square marks it in all three pole figures. It lies away from the $(100)$
# density, as the pole of a great circle must, and near the densest part of the $(010)$
# figure. The second observation is a clue to the crystal direction of the candidate
# fibre.
#
# Draw the edge of the band whose points lie within 10° of the great circle. Its opening
# angle about `rOrth` is therefore 80°.

# Count the measurements inside that band. Because `rOrth` is antipodal, its angular
# distance ranges from 0° to 90°.

# Nearly 62% of the measurements have their crystal $a$ axis within 10° of the great
# circle. This first, one-direction test looks convincing, but it has not yet tested a
# complete orientation.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Which crystal direction is the fibre axis
#
# A fibre needs a crystal direction as well as a specimen direction. It is the set of
# orientations that map one fixed crystal direction onto one fixed specimen direction
# while leaving rotation about that direction free.
# [Fibres of Orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFibre_py.html) develops this geometry.
#
# The inverse pole figure of `rOrth` asks which crystal direction points along that
# specimen axis.

# The density piles up near $(010)$, so the candidate fibre maps the crystal $b$ axis
# onto `rOrth`.

# %%
# candidate fibre through orientation space
f = fibre(Miller(0, 1, 0, cs), rOrth)

# percentage of measurements within 10 degrees of the fibre

# The 28% is less than half of the 62%, and the difference is the point. Lying in the
# girdle says only that the $a$ axis avoids `rOrth`. Lying near the fibre says in
# addition that the $b$ axis points towards `rOrth`. Every orientation on this fibre lies
# in the girdle, but most orientations in the girdle do not lie on the fibre.
#
# The exact fibre is a one-dimensional curve and has zero volume in orientation space.
# [volume](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.volume.html) reports the fraction of measured orientations inside
# the specified 10° tube around that curve. The radius is therefore part of the result.
# For an unknown direction pair, [fibre.fit](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/fibre.fit.html) can search for a candidate,
# but the same geometrical and sampling checks are still required.

# ## What the ODF says
#
# A true fibre texture has constant density along its fibre. An *orientation
# distribution function* (ODF) estimates density throughout orientation space. Estimate
# it from the measurements and follow it along `f`. [ODF Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD2ODF_py.html)
# explains the kernel and its halfwidth.

# %%
# pixels are no independent draws, so the halfwidth is named: MATLAB's default
odf = calcDensity(ori, halfwidth=10 * degree)

# plot the ODF along the candidate fibre
plot(odf, f, lineWidth=2)
plt.ylim(0, 26)

# evaluate the same fibre points to report the plotted range
fibreOri = f.orientation()
fibreDensity = odf.eval(fibreOri)

# A fibre texture would give a flat line. This one swings between 5.5 and 19.6 multiples
# of a uniform distribution, a factor of three and a half. Three peaks rise by at least
# 1 mrd in every half turn. Together with the 28% fibre fraction, this settles the
# question: the map does not show a fibre texture. It contains a few strong components
# that share a plane.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Why the peaks are there
#
# Plot the complete density in sections through orientation space to see where the
# variation along the fibre comes from.

# %%
plot(odf, 'sigma')

# %% [markdown]
# The sections contain large isolated spots rather than a continuous ridge. This is what
# a densely sampled map with few grains produces: each grain contributes thousands of
# nearly identical orientations, so one large grain can become one ODF peak.
#
# Here every measurement has equal weight. On a regular scan that is approximately an
# area-weighted texture, not a count in which every grain has one vote. The estimate
# describes the grains in the measured area and need not represent the rock from which
# that small area was taken. For texture analysis, a coarser step over a larger area
# would have been the better measurement. Reconstructing grains also makes it possible to
# compare area-weighted and equal-grain orientation distributions.
