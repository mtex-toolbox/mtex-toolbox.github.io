# # CSL Boundaries
#
# Most misorientations bring the lattices on the two sides of a boundary into no particular
# relation. At a coincidence site lattice (CSL) relationship, some sites of the two lattices
# coincide.
#
# The number $\Sigma$ is the reciprocal density of those sites. Thus, an exact $\Sigma 3$
# relationship has one coincidence site for every three lattice sites. The $\Sigma 3$
# relationship is the misorientation of a coherent annealing twin in a cubic metal.
#
# This does not make every measured $\Sigma 3$ segment a coherent or low-energy boundary. A
# CSL relationship fixes the three misorientation degrees of freedom, but not the two
# degrees that specify the boundary plane. The plane, chemistry, and deviation from the
# exact relationship also affect boundary energy and properties. Low $\Sigma$ is therefore
# a useful geometric classification, not a monotonic measure of specialness.
#
# Some low $\Sigma$ populations, especially coherent twins, resist intergranular corrosion
# and cracking. Increasing their fraction and breaking up the connected network of
# susceptible boundaries is the aim of grain boundary engineering. This page shows how to
# find and analyse them in an EBSD map.
#
# The workflow assumes [grain reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html),
# [boundary misorientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryMisorientations_py.html), and
# [misorientation theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html). The density section also uses
# [kernel density estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html).

# ## Reconstruct the boundary network
#
# The example is a single-phase cubic iron map. MTEX's [`CSL`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CSL.html) generator is for
# cubic symmetry. The plotting convention below matches the specimen frame stored with this
# data set.

# ## What the orientation map shows
#
# Thin bands of similar colours cross many of the larger grains. They are the first visual
# clue that this recrystallised material contains many annealing twins.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Compare the reconstruction with image quality
#
# Diffraction-pattern image quality often drops at a boundary. Plotting it beneath
# translucent orientation colours checks the reconstruction against a signal that was not
# used to classify the boundary.

# Many dark image-quality bands follow the reconstructed interfaces. The narrow coloured
# lamellae remain visible through the translucent layer.

# ## Detect the Sigma 3 boundaries
#
# [`angle`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.angle.html) measures the smallest distance between a boundary
# misorientation and the symmetrically equivalent ideal relationships. Here the fixed
# tolerance is 3 degrees.

# ## How much of the network is Sigma 3
#
# The summary reports 17,569 iron--iron segments. Of these, 7,499, or 42.7 percent, lie
# within 3 degrees of $\Sigma 3$. The gold segments are not scattered randomly: many
# continue along complete runs from one triple point to the next.
#
# The tolerance is a choice. The Brandon criterion uses $15^\circ / \sqrt{\Sigma}$, which
# is 8.7 degrees for $\Sigma 3$ and narrows as $\Sigma$ increases. The 3 degree tolerance
# above is stricter. Neither tolerance determines the unmeasured boundary-plane inclination.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Triple points where Sigma 3 boundaries meet
#
# A triple point is where exactly three boundary segments meet and separate three real
# grains. Its `boundaryId` property gives the three incident segments. The condition below
# selects points where at least two of them match the $\Sigma 3$ relationship.
#
# [`isTwinning`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grainBoundary.isTwinning.html) is the convenience form of the angular
# comparison used above. It also checks the phases on the two sides of each segment.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## What the selected triple points mean
#
# The map contains 83 such points. Many mark where a twin lamella ends against another
# boundary. Their number is one measure of how strongly twinned a material is, although it
# does not describe network connectivity by itself.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Merge across the twins
#
# A twin belongs to the grain in which it grew. Passing the selected segments to
# [`merge`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.merge.html) dissolves those interfaces and groups the grains on their
# two sides. See [Merging Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainMerge_py.html) for the bookkeeping after this operation.

# %%
# merge grains that share a selected Sigma 3 segment

# %%
# overlay the merged-grain boundaries on the previous plot
hold(True)
plot(mergedGrains.boundary, lineColor='w', lineWidth=3)

# %% [markdown]
# ## What merging changes
#
# The merge reduces 885 reconstructed grains to 415 groups. Many white outlines enclose
# several coloured grains; those regions were one grain before it twinned.
#
# Merging records which grains belong together, but it does not identify which child was
# the original grain. That distinction needs an additional rule, as explained on the
# merging page.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Compare other low Sigma relationships
#
# Other low $\Sigma$ boundaries can be selected in the same way. This comparison
# deliberately uses the wider fixed tolerance of 5 degrees for every relationship.

# ## What the other relationships contribute
#
# In the order $\Sigma 5$, $\Sigma 7$, $\Sigma 9$, and $\Sigma 11$, the output gives 26,
# 41, 504, and 187 segments. Thus, $\Sigma 9$ and $\Sigma 11$ account for 2.9 and 1.1
# percent of the network, while $\Sigma 5$ and $\Sigma 7$ together contribute fewer than 70
# segments.
#
# These colours occur mainly in short pieces rather than along complete boundaries. The
# prominence of $\Sigma 9$ is not accidental: when two different $\Sigma 3$ twin variants
# meet, their composition can be a $\Sigma 9$ relationship.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The coincidences belong to the lattice
#
# [`CSL`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CSL.html) accepts a list of $\Sigma$ values and returns their misorientations
# ordered by $\Sigma$ and, within one $\Sigma$, by angle.

# Which rotations are coincidences, and their $\Sigma$, depend on the Bravais lattice, not
# on the point group. The three cubic lattices, primitive, body-centred and face-centred,
# share their coincidences, so the list above holds for bcc iron as well as for fcc copper
# or nickel. A centred lattice of lower symmetry has coincidences of its own. A crystal frame
# built from a space group symbol, such as `crystalFrame('R-3m', ...)`, or read from a CIF
# file keeps the centring of its lattice, and `CSL` searches the lattice it describes.

# The lattice need not be cubic. A hexagonal lattice with a rational $c^2/a^2$ has exact

# ## What the fundamental-region plot shows

# The cloud is not uniform. It forms a dense clump at a corner of the region, and the red

# ## Estimate the boundary misorientation distribution
#
# A density estimated from the segment misorientations makes the same observation
# quantitative. The `halfwidth` is the angular smoothing scale, while `bandwidth` sets the
# harmonic truncation. The displayed summary confirms that the MDF retains grain-exchange
# symmetry.
#
# This is a boundary, or correlated, MDF. It contains one sample per segment, so long or
# finely sampled boundaries contribute more than short ones.
# [Misorientation Distribution Function](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationDistributionFunction_py.html) compares
# this population with the uncorrelated MDF implied by texture alone.
