# # The Schmid Factor
#
# An applied tension does not shear every [slip system](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SlipSystems_py.html)
# equally. The *Schmid factor* measures how much of that loading geometry
# acts along a slip direction within its slip plane. This page starts with
# one crystal and then applies the same calculation to every grain in a map.

# ## Read the loading geometry
#
# Consider nickel with one representative fcc slip system
# $[01\bar1](111)$ and a uniaxial tension direction $\mathbf r=[001]$.
# All three directions are initially expressed in the crystal frame.

# %%

# plane normal $\mathbf n$, and the red arrow is the tension direction.

# %% [markdown]
# The red arrow is perpendicular to neither the blue arrow nor the black
# arrow. The loading therefore has a nonzero component that shears this
# plane along $\mathbf b$.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Define the Schmid factor
#
# For uniaxial tension, the signed Schmid factor $m$ is the product of two
# direction cosines:
#
# $$m = \cos\angle(\mathbf r,\mathbf n)\,
#       \cos\angle(\mathbf r,\mathbf b).$$
#
# A zero factor means that $\mathbf r$ is perpendicular to either
# $\mathbf b$ or $\mathbf n$. The system then receives no resolved shear.
# The sign selects the shear sense; activation comparisons usually use
# $|m|$ when opposite Burgers-vector signs are identified.

m = np.cos(angle(r, sS.n, symmetry=False)) * np.cos(angle(r, sS.b, symmetry=False))

# The [`SchmidFactor`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/slipSystem.SchmidFactor.html) method performs the same
# calculation. Both routes give $m=-0.4082$ for this signed system.

# ## Map one system over every tension direction

# `S2FunHarmonic` spherical function. It can be plotted or searched without
# first constructing a direction grid.

# between the slip direction and the plane normal.

# A loading state may instead be supplied as a `stressTensor`. Here the

# For a stress tensor, `SchmidFactor` contracts the Schmid tensor with the
# stress after normalizing by the difference between its largest and

# shear stress $\tau$.
