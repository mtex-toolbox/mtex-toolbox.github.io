# # Line intersections
#
# A straight line drawn across a microstructure is a one-dimensional probe. Every grain
# boundary it crosses ends one intercept and starts the next. Counting these crossings is
# one of the oldest measurements in microscopy. On a micrograph it needs neither labelled
# grain regions nor a model for grain shape, only visible boundaries and a calibrated
# ruler.
#
# In MTEX the boundary network comes from [grain reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html).
# A grain boundary starts as a list of short segments. Each segment lies between
# neighbouring EBSD pixels assigned to different grains. The
# [intersect](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grainBoundary.intersect.html) command finds where a test line crosses that
# reconstructed boundary network.
#
# We use a magnesium map containing thin twin lamellae.
# [Smoothing](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainSmoothing_py.html) removes the pixel-grid staircase, but it also moves the
# boundary. Use the same documented smoothing settings when comparing measurements between
# maps.

# A line is specified by its start and end points in map coordinates.

# The white diagonal crosses the lamellae obliquely. Its direction is part of the
# measurement, not merely a plotting choice.

# ## Find the crossed boundary segments
#
# `intersect` returns the segments the line crosses and the crossing points, in the order
# in which the line meets them.

# Each blue marker is a reported crossing. Adjacent boundary segments share vertices. A
# line through a vertex crosses two segments at the same place, so two markers can land on
# one geometric crossing. Avoid such vertices when placing test lines, or consolidate
# coincident points before counting them.

# ## Mean lineal intercept
#
# For a traverse of length $L$ with $N$ boundary crossings, the mean lineal intercept is
# $\bar{\ell} = L/N$. It is a standard measure of apparent grain size. Here the three
# quantities are printed because they are the result of the example.

# This 43.84 µm traverse crosses 18 boundary segments. Its mean lineal intercept is
# 2.44 µm. This is apparent grain size on a two-dimensional section, not a mean grain
# diameter in three dimensions.

# ## From one traverse to a measurement
#
# One line is a thin estimate, and this one runs diagonally across a map full of twin
# lamellae, every one of which it counts. In practice, add the lengths of many parallel
# test lines and divide by their total number of crossings. Repeat this measurement in
# several directions for an elongated microstructure. A line along the elongation crosses
# fewer boundaries than one drawn across it.
#
# This directional sensitivity is useful, but it means that a single line must not be
# presented as a direction-independent grain size. A formal measurement also needs a
# sampling design. Follow the boundary-counting rules of the applicable standard.
#
# A single line still gives a useful reconstruction check. Compare its crossing count with
# what [the grain sizes](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ShapeParameters_py.html) imply. If they disagree badly, the
# reconstruction is finding boundaries that are not there, or missing ones that are.
