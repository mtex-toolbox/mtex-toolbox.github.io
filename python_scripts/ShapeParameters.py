# # Grain Size and Basic Shape Parameters
#
# The outline of a grain is a polygon with hundreds of vertices. A shape parameter
# compresses that outline into a number that can be plotted, histogrammed, and compared
# between specimens. The price is that almost all other information about the outline is
# lost.
#
# This page covers direct measurements of a grain in a two-dimensional section. It assumes
# that the grains have been [reconstructed](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) and explains why
# their boundaries are [smoothed](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainSmoothing_py.html). Use
# [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html) first if selecting complete grains away from
# the map edge is unfamiliar.
#
# A measured section is not a three-dimensional grain. Large grains are more likely to be
# cut, and most cuts miss the widest part of a grain. Quantities such as `area` and
# `equivalentRadius` therefore describe the observed section unless a stereological model
# or a standard says how to infer a three-dimensional size from them.
#
# The most useful scalar properties are listed below. Lengths are returned in the map's
# measurement unit and areas in its square.
#
# | | | | |
# |---|---|---|---|
# | `numPixel` | number of measurements in the grain | `area` | area of the section |
# | `boundarySize` | number of outline segments | `perimeter` | length of the outline |
# | `subBoundarySize` | number of subgrain boundary segments | `subBoundaryLength` | length of subgrain boundaries |
# | `diameter` | largest vertex-to-vertex distance | `caliper` | caliper or Feret diameter |
# | `equivalentPerimeter` | perimeter of the equal-area circle | `equivalentRadius` | radius of the equal-area circle |
# | `shapeFactor` | perimeter divided by equivalent perimeter | `paris` | indentation relative to the convex hull |
# | `sphericity` | boundary irregularity in the ice-grain example | `isBoundary` | does the grain touch the map edge? |
# | `hasHole` | does the grain enclose another grain? | `isInclusion` | is the grain enclosed by another grain? |
# | `numNeighbors` | number of neighbouring grains | `triplePoints` | list of triple points |
# | `boundary` | list of grain boundary segments | `innerBoundary` | list of subgrain boundary segments |
# | `x`, `y` | coordinates of the outline vertices | `centroid` | area centroid |
#
# A hole and an inclusion are the same enclosure viewed from opposite sides. The
# containing grain has a hole, and the contained grain is an inclusion.

# The black network separates the reconstructed grains. Smoothing has removed the
# square-grid staircase while retaining the larger-scale turns of the boundaries. It is a
# measurement choice, not recovered sub-pixel detail.

# A grain touching the map edge continues beyond the measured field. Its visible area and
# outline are truncated, so we exclude such grains from the per-grain comparisons below. A

#
# Size comes in two forms: the number of measurements assigned to a grain and the area
# occupied by its observed section.

# %%
grains[8].numPixel

# %%
grains[8].area

# %% [markdown]
# `numPixel` is a count, while `area` is in the square of the map unit. They are
# proportional only when one step size is used throughout the map. The count is useful
# during reconstruction because `minPixel` is expressed in it. Physical area is usually the
# quantity to report.
#
# The number-weighted area distribution is strongly skewed.

# %%

plt.hist(grains.area)
plt.xlabel('grain area')
plt.ylabel('number of grains')

# %% [markdown]
# Nearly every grain falls into the first bar. The plot answers how many grains have each
# area, so numerous small grains dominate even when they occupy little of the section.
#
# Weighting each grain by its area asks a different question: what fraction of the
# observed section belongs to grains in each size class? `histogram(grains, grouped=True)`
# draws grouped bars, one colour per indexed phase.

# %%
histogram(grains, grouped=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The small-grain bar is much less dominant after area weighting. Each bar height is now
# a percentage of the analysed section rather than a grain count. `histogram(grains)`
# draws the same values as overlaid phase histograms instead of side-by-side bars.

# %%
histogram(grains)

# %% [markdown]
# The phase distributions overlap; they are not stacked and their heights should not be
# added by eye. The many tiny grains remain in the list, but they contribute little area.
# The largest forsterite grain and its fraction of the analysed interior-grain area are
# printed below.

largestForsteriteArea = max(forsteriteArea)

largestForsteriteFraction

# %% [markdown]
# The largest forsterite section covers 2.805 mm² and accounts for 15.31 percent of the
# analysed interior-grain area. The many small grains have not gone away; area weighting
# has changed how much each one counts.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Boundary segments and perimeter
#
# `boundarySize` and `perimeter` are the same pair one dimension lower: a count of
# outline segments and their total length.

# %%
grains[8].boundarySize

# %%
grains[8].perimeter

# %% [markdown]
# Both are shortcuts for asking the grain boundary itself, which is a list of segments
# with one `segLength` each.

# %%
len(grains[8].boundary)

# %%
np.sum(grains[8].boundary.segLength)

# %% [markdown]
# The two pairs react differently to processing. `numPixel` remains tied to the
# measurements, whereas smoothing resamples the outline and can change both
# `boundarySize` and `perimeter`. By default, `perimeter` measures only the outer loop.
# The option `withInclusion` adds the loops around grains enclosed inside it.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Diameter and the equivalent circle
#
# The `diameter` is the longest distance between any two vertices of the outline. It is
# one of the directional caliper or Feret measures developed in
# [Projection Parameters](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ProjectionBasedParameters_py.html).

# %%
grains[8].diameter

# %% [markdown]
# Another characteristic length comes from the circle with the same area. Its
# `equivalentRadius` gives the diameter below. No shape of that area has a shorter
# perimeter than the circle, and no grain of that area has a smaller maximum diameter.

# %%
2 * grains[8].equivalentRadius

# %%
grains[8].equivalentPerimeter

# %% [markdown]
# ## Departure from a circle
#
# The `shapeFactor` is $F=P/P_{\mathrm{eq}}$, where $P$ is the perimeter and
# $P_{\mathrm{eq}}$ is the equivalent perimeter. It is at least 1 and grows when a grain
# is elongated, indented, or ragged.
#
# Other literature sometimes calls $4\pi A/P^2=1/F^2$ the circularity or even the shape
# factor. State the formula when comparing values between software or publications.

# %% [markdown]
# The minimum, median, and maximum are 1.058, 1.221, and 1.662. In the map, the
# high-value yellow grains are visibly lobed or elongated, while compact grains are dark
# blue. The measure cannot tell those causes apart: a smooth ellipse and a round grain
# with a frayed boundary can have the same value.
#
# The same information can be scaled as the relative difference between the `perimeter`
# and the `equivalentPerimeter`.

# Round shapes are near zero in this map. The quantity equals $1-1/F$ and is bounded
# above by 1 rather than being unbounded.
#
# A third measure compares the perimeter with the grain's own convex hull. `paris`, the
# Percentile Average Relative Indented Surface, is reported in percent. An elongated but
# smoothly bounded grain has a small `paris` because its hull follows it closely. Bays and
# inlets increase it. Inclusion loops are excluded from both `paris` and the default
# perimeter. [Convex Hull Parameters](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/HullBasedParameters_py.html) develops this comparison.

# The median `paris` is 2.77 percent, its maximum is 43.30, and its correlation with
# `shapeFactor` is 0.472. Among the complete grains, both measures select the same extreme
# grain. In the full plotted map, including truncated edge grains, they select different
# extremes. Their partial agreement is the point: `shapeFactor` counts elongation as a
# departure from a circle, whereas `paris` does not. The changed selection also shows why
# the edge-grain rule belongs in a reported method.

# ## Perimeter-area fractal dimension
#
# Boundary length depends on the scale at which it is measured. This is the coastline
# problem. A perimeter-area fractal dimension describes how rapidly perimeter grows with
# grain size across a population and has been related to dynamic-recrystallisation
# conditions.
#
# This is a population estimator, not a box-counting dimension of one grain. It assumes
# that the grains are statistically self-similar over the fitted size range. If
# $P\propto r^D$, a straight line fitted to $\log(P)$ against $\log(r)$ has slope $D$. A
# family of geometrically similar smooth grains has $D=1$; increasingly convoluted
# boundaries can give a slope between 1 and 2.

# Treat the estimate with care. Pixel spacing sets the smallest visible feature, small
# grains provide very few boundary samples, and smoothing removes exactly the excursions
# that the measure is intended to count. The next comparison reuses one reconstruction so
# that only the boundary processing changes. The zero-iteration case is the actual pixel
# staircase; calling `smoothBoundary(rawGrains, 0)` would still simplify and resample it.

  print(f'{iter:2d} smoothing iterations: fractal dimension {ab[0]:.3f}')

# %% [markdown]
# The pixel staircase gives 1.128 because grid corners add artificial length. Five
# iterations give 1.011, while 25 iterations push the estimate to 0.965, below the range
# of a self-similar plane curve. That is a diagnostic that the estimator's assumptions
# have failed, not a physical property of the rock. Compare specimens only after matching
# the pixel resolution, grain-size cutoff, segmentation, and smoothing procedure.
