# # EBSD Tutorial
#
# This tutorial follows one EBSD map from import to phase and orientation maps,
# reconstructed grains, pole figures, and inverse pole figures. It is a first route through
# MTEX rather than a guide to every choice.
#
# Read [General Concepts](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GeneralConcepts.html) first if MTEX objects and selections are
# new to you. For your own data, read [Reference Frame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) before
# trusting any orientation-dependent result.

# %%
from mtex import *

# %% [markdown]
# ## Data import
#
# MTEX reads text formats such as `.ang` and `.ctf` and open binary formats such as `.osc`
# and `.h5`. The [import chapter](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDImport_py.html) lists the supported formats and the
# information that may be missing from them.
#
# The interactive import wizard, `importWizard()`, previews the file and writes a
# reproducible import script:
#
# ![](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/figures/python/importWizard.png)
#
# Notice the separate phase table, file header, map preview, and map and Euler
# reference-frame selectors. Check all four before asking the wizard to generate the
# script.
#
# The generated script ultimately calls [EBSD.load](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.load.html). Here the file and its
# Euler correction are known because both are packaged with MTEX:

# %%
# load example data packaged with MTEX
fileName = mtexdatafile('forsterite')
EulerCorrection = rotation.byAxisAngle(xvector, 180 * degree)
ebsd = EBSD.load(fileName, eulerCorrection=EulerCorrection)

ebsd

# %% [markdown]
# The correction above is specific to this file; do not copy it blindly to another data
# set. The displayed [EBSD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.EBSD.html) summary is the import audit: it lists the
# phases, counts, crystal symmetries, scan extent, and stored columns.
#
# An `EBSD` object is a vectorized list with one entry per measurement, not an image. Its
# properties in `ebsd.prop` are per-pixel values that remain aligned when the map is subset.
# Its options in `ebsd.opt` contain scan-level information such as headers.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Phase map
#
# With no colour data supplied, `plot` colours the measurements by phase. The
# reference-frame indicator is switched on for the first check.

# %%
plot(ebsd, refFrame='on')

# %% [markdown]
# Forsterite dominates, while enstatite and diopside form separate regions. The white
# measurements have the phase `notIndexed` because their diffraction patterns could not be
# indexed; they are not missing pixels.
#
# The corner indicator shows how the specimen frame is laid out on screen. A reference
# frame is the coordinate system in which the data is expressed, and it is distinct from
# the crystal symmetry of any phase.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Orientation map
#
# Each phase has its own crystal symmetry, so select one phase before asking for an
# orientation array. The selection itself displays how many measurements it contains:

# %%
ebsd['Forsterite']

# %% [markdown]
# Its orientations form another vectorized object. The display confirms its size and its
# crystal and specimen frames:

# %%
ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations

# %% [markdown]
# Passing those orientations as the colour data produces an inverse pole figure map.

# %%
plot(ebsd['Forsterite'], ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations, micronbar='off')

# %% [markdown]
# Similar colours suggest similar orientations, but a colour patch is not a grain. The
# default IPF-Z key is a projection, so it can hide orientation differences, and a real
# grain may contain a smooth orientation gradient. See [IPF Maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html) to draw
# and choose the colour key explicitly.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Grain reconstruction
#
# This packaged example goes directly from import to segmentation. For a real map, inspect
# its quality properties and use [Select](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSelect_py.html) to isolate suspect measurements
# first. [Denoising](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDDenoising_py.html) and [Filling Missing Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDFilling_py.html)
# change the map and need a specimen-specific justification.
#
# [calcGrains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcGrains.html) segments the measurement list into regions. A grain
# is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels produced by
# segmentation. A phase change is always a grain boundary, while same-phase neighbours are
# separated here when their misorientation exceeds the chosen angle. A connected
# `notIndexed` area can itself form a grain; it is not a gap in the scan.
#
# The 10 degree angle is an example parameter, not a universal definition. The option
# `minPixel` removes indexed grains smaller than five pixels and marks their pixels
# `notIndexed`.

# %%
# reconstruct grains with a 10 degree misorientation angle
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=10 * degree, minPixel=5)
grains

# %%
# smooth only the boundary geometry
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 5)

# %% [markdown]
# The returned [grain2d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.grain2d.html) object is a vectorized list of grains. Its
# display reports the count by phase and the available grain properties.
# [smoothBoundary](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.smoothBoundary.html) removes the pixel staircase from the
# outlines; it does not change which measurements belong together. See
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) for choosing and testing segmentation
# criteria.
#
# Overlaying the boundaries provides the first visual check:

# %%
# overlay the grain boundaries on the orientation map
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Most boundaries follow clear changes in orientation colour. Where they do not, inspect
# the colour key and the underlying misorientations rather than tuning the angle to the
# picture alone.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Crystal orientation glyphs
#
# A crystal shape can be used as an orientation glyph. The predefined olivine polyhedron is
# rotated by each grain's mean orientation and placed at its centroid.

# %%
# define an idealized olivine crystal shape
cS = crystalShape.olivine(ebsd['Forsterite'].CS)

# retain Forsterite grains with more than 100 measurements
grains = grains['Forsterite', grains.numPixel > 100]
grains

# %%
# overlay the oriented crystal glyphs
hold(True)
plot(grains, 0.7 * cS, colored=True)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The grain summary above gives the number retained by the selection. The repeated face
# orientations reveal the preferred orientation, or texture, of this population.
#
# These glyphs do not measure three-dimensional crystal habit or grain morphology; the
# shape is idealized and its linear scale follows the square root of grain area. See
# [Crystal Shapes](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalShapes_py.html) for constructing other glyphs.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Pole figures
#
# A [pole figure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationPoleFigure_py.html) asks where a chosen crystal direction points
# in the specimen for every measured orientation. The command is
# [plotPF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.plotPDF.html). Here the three crystallographic axes are plotted as
# filled density contours.

# %%
# select three crystal directions
h = Miller([1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], ebsd['Forsterite'].CS)

# plot their specimen-direction distributions
plotPF(ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations, h, 'contourf')
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The (010) poles collect in a strong maximum near the rim. The (100) poles occupy a broad
# band, while the (001) poles form several concentrations. A random orientation population
# would be uniform apart from sampling variation, so these concentrations are evidence of
# texture.
#
# Every measurement has equal weight in these plots. On a regular map this is area
# weighting, so large grains contribute more than small grains and the scanned area must
# represent the specimen.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inverse pole figures
#
# An [inverse pole figure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationInversePoleFigure_py.html) asks the complementary
# question: which crystal direction points along a chosen specimen direction? The command
# is [plotIPF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.plotIPDF.html).

# %%
# select the specimen axes
r = vector3d.cat(vector3d.X, vector3d.Y, vector3d.Z)

# plot their crystal-direction distributions
plotIPF(ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations, r, 'contourf')
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The strongest concentration for the specimen x axis lies toward the crystal [010]
# direction. This is the complementary view of the (010) pole-figure maximum. The y and z
# distributions are broader and lie mainly along the sector edge between [001] and [100].
#
# Pole figures and inverse pole figures are projections of the same three-dimensional
# orientation data, and neither is a complete description.
# [ODF Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD2ODF_py.html) explains how pixel weighting, grain weighting, and kernel
# choice affect a continuous orientation distribution.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Next
#
# Continue with [the grain tutorial](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainTutorial_py.html) to measure and select the
# reconstructed grains. Then use [the grain boundary tutorial](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryTutorial_py.html) for
# the crystallographic relations between neighbouring grains.
#
# For texture analysis, [the ODF tutorial](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTutorial_py.html) turns individual orientations
# into a function that can be evaluated, integrated, and compared.

# ## Technical Details
#
# `calcGrains(ebsd, angle=10*degree, minPixel=5)` gives 14, 490, 213 and 168 notIndexed,
# forsterite, enstatite and diopside grains and 36193 boundary segments where MATLAB has 9,
# 489, 208, 167 and 35402: the cull of the small grains widens a small difference in the
# segmentation, as on the other forsterite pages. The 262 forsterite grains above 100
# pixels agree, with 142943 pixels for MATLAB's 142951.
