# # ODF Tutorial
#
# An orientation distribution function (ODF) describes the texture of a specimen as a
# continuous density over all crystal orientations. It is the common result of two
# different experiments: orientation maps measure orientations individually, while
# diffraction measures pole figures.
#
# Read [General Concepts](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GeneralConcepts.html) first if MTEX objects and selections are
# new to you. The [EBSD tutorial](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDTutorial_py.html) introduces orientation maps, and the
# [pole figure tutorial](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureTutorial_py.html) develops diffraction data.
#
# MTEX reports ODF values in multiples of a random distribution, mrd. A random texture has
# value 1 everywhere. A value of 10 means ten times the random density near that
# orientation; it is not the volume fraction at one exact orientation.
#
# This tutorial follows three routes to an ODF: estimate one from individual orientations,
# reconstruct one from pole figures, and define a model ODF.

# ## From individual orientations
#
# The titanium map contains 8148 measurement points, but 48 could not be indexed and
# therefore have no orientation. Select the indexed titanium phase before estimating its
# density.

# %%
# load the titanium example without displaying the EBSD summary
ebsd = mtexdata('titanium', verbose=False)

# select the indexed orientations
titanium = ebsd['Titanium (Alpha)']
ori = titanium.orientations

# display the number of orientations used in the estimate
numOrientations = len(ori)
numOrientations

# %%
# colour the map with one explicit inverse pole figure key
ipfKey = ipfColorKey(ori)
plot(titanium, ipfKey.orientation2color(ori))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading the orientation map
#
# The map contains broad regions of similar colour rather than 8100 independent colour
# speckles. Neighbouring EBSD pixels are spatially correlated because many sample the same
# crystal.
#
# [calcDensity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/rotation.calcDensity.html) uses kernel density estimation. It places a
# smooth kernel at every orientation and adds the kernels. The halfwidth controls how far
# each measurement is spread in orientation space; here it is set explicitly to 10 degrees.

# %%
halfwidth = 10 * degree
odfFromOrientations = calcDensity(ori, halfwidth=halfwidth)

# ## Reading the ODF summary
#
# The summary identifies an [SO3FunHarmonic](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunHarmonic.SO3FunHarmonic.html) with
# bandwidth 25 and weight 1. Harmonic coefficients are its numerical representation, while
# the weight confirms that the ODF is normalized as one complete texture.
#
# Compute the maximum instead of estimating it from a colour scale.

# %%
# plot sigma sections for the hexagonal titanium phase
plot(odfFromOrientations, 'sigma')
mtexColorbar(title='orientation density (mrd)')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading the estimated ODF
#
# The maximum is 9.0 mrd. In the sigma sections, the high-density region extends through
# neighbouring sections because the estimate is a continuous function rather than a list.
#
# The 10 degree halfwidth is an analysis choice, not a property of titanium. A smaller
# value resolves finer structure and usually raises the maximum, while a larger value
# merges nearby features. Neither change is automatically more accurate.
#
# The sampling weights matter as well. Pixel orientations weight mapped area, while grain
# mean orientations give every reconstructed grain one vote unless grain area is supplied
# as a weight. [ODF Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD2ODF_py.html) develops halfwidth selection and weighting.

# ## From pole figures
#
# Diffraction does not measure individual orientations. For each lattice plane, it measures
# intensity over specimen directions. Load three orthorhombic pole figures and display
# their input summary.

# load the pole figure example
pf = mtexdata('ptx', verbose=False)

# plot the measured intensities
plot(pf)
mtexColorbar(title='measured intensity')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading the measured pole figures
#
# The summary reports three grids of 72 by 17 specimen directions, for 3672 intensity
# values in total. The three plots have distinct spot patterns because each reflection
# places a different constraint on the unknown ODF.
#
# [calcODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.calcODF.html) finds an ODF whose recalculated pole figures fit those
# measurements. The `silent` flag hides the solver iteration table but leaves the returned
# ODF summary visible.

# ## Reading the reconstructed ODF summary
#
# This result is an [SO3FunRBF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunRBF.SO3FunRBF.html), represented as a weighted sum of
# kernels on an orientation grid. It is the same scientific quantity as the harmonic ODF
# above despite the different representation.

# The maximum is 17.8 mrd, so this reconstructed texture is sharper than the titanium
# estimate under their respective smoothing choices. Peak height alone should not be used
# to compare specimens unless the estimation and reconstruction settings are also
# comparable.
#
# The first validation is to recalculate the measured reflections.

# ## Reading the recalculated pole figures
#
# The broad maxima occupy the same regions as in the measured plots above. The
# recalculated fields are smooth and do not reproduce every measured point-to-point
# fluctuation. A systematic shift or a missing maximum would instead indicate a problem
# with the input, reference frame, corrections, or reconstruction settings.
#
# Agreement does not prove that the ODF is unique. Pole-figure inversion cannot recover
# every part of an ODF, even from noiseless measurements.
# [The Ghost Effect](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFAmbiguity_py.html) explains the missing information, and
# [Ghost Correction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFGhostCorrection_py.html) explains the additional
# assumption used by MTEX by default. Continue with [ODF Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html)
# for solver choices and quantitative fit measures.

# ## Model ODFs
#
# An ODF need not come from measurements. A model ODF provides a known reference texture
# for interpretation, simulation, or comparison with an estimate.
#
# The gamma fibre is a standard cubic rolling-texture component. Every orientation on its
# ideal curve places a crystal {111} plane normal parallel to the specimen normal
# direction. Define both symmetries explicitly so this model does not inherit anything from
# the orthorhombic diffraction example.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('cubic')
ss = specimenFrame('orthorhombic')
gammaFibre = fibre.gamma(cs, ss)

# spread density by 10 degrees around the ideal gamma fibre

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading the model ODF
#
# The maximum is 11.5 mrd. The fibre shows up as a band running across the whole width of
# the $\varphi_2 = 45^\circ$ section, not as an isolated peak. It is weaker in the
# neighbouring sections at 30 and 60 degrees and absent from the remaining three, so most
# of the density sits in a narrow range of $\varphi_2$. The 10 degree kernel gives the band
# finite width, so this is a smooth model around an ideal fibre rather than density
# confined to a line.
#
# [Model ODFs](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFModeling_py.html) combines uniform, unimodal, fibre, and Bingham components.
# [Fibre ODFs](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/FibreODFs_py.html) develops the role of the halfwidth and the pole figures
# produced by a fibre.

# %% [markdown]
# ## One ODF interface
#
# The three displays above report `SO3FunHarmonic`, `SO3FunRBF`, and `SO3FunCBF`. These
# class names describe storage and approximation strategies, not three definitions of
# texture. All implement the [SO3Fun](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.SO3Fun.html) interface for evaluation,
# plotting, integration, extrema, rotation, arithmetic, and random sampling.
#
# This common interface is how MTEX connects EBSD, pole figures, texture models,
# crystal-plasticity input, and anisotropic material properties.
# [ODF Analysis](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFAnalysis.html) develops plots, components, and scalar texture measures.
# [Random Sampling](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RandomSampling_py.html) turns any ODF back into discrete orientations,
# while [Tensors](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Tensors.html) uses an ODF to average direction-dependent crystal
# properties.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The maths behind the two data routes
#
# For an orientation $g$, the ODF is the normalized material-volume density
#
# $$f(g) = \frac{1}{V}\frac{\mathrm{d}V(g)}{\mathrm{d}g}.$$
#
# Its integral over orientation space is 1. With the uniform probability measure used by
# MTEX, the random ODF is therefore the constant function 1 and ODF values have units of
# mrd.
#
# For measured orientations $g_1,\ldots,g_N$ and a normalized kernel $\psi$, kernel
# density estimation gives
#
# $$f_N(g) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\psi(g g_n^{-1}).$$
#
# The kernel halfwidth controls the smoothing described above. Crystal and specimen
# symmetries identify equivalent orientations in both the kernel and the domain.
#
# A pole figure is instead a projection of the ODF. For a crystal direction $h$ and
# specimen direction $r$, its pole density integrates over the orientation fibre that maps
# $h$ to $r$:
#
# $$P_h(r) = \int_{\{g:\,g h=r\}} f(g)\,\mathrm{d}g.$$
#
# Reconstructing an ODF from these projections is the inverse problem used by `calcODF`.

# ## Technical Details
#
# The titanium estimate agrees with MATLAB's to the digit: 8100 orientations, bandwidth 25,
# maximum 9.0003 mrd, and the same sigma sections. The ptx reconstruction places its kernels
# on 29818 orientations where MATLAB's equispaced grid has 29772. The solver stops after six
# iterations under MATLAB's stopping rule, and its maximum, 17.21 mrd, is 3 percent below
# MATLAB's 17.72 (the text quotes 17.8). The maximum is sensitive to the stopping point:
# five iterations give 12.8 mrd and seven give 23.8. The recalculated pole figures agree by
# eye. The model ODF, its display, its maximum 11.4879 (MATLAB 11.4878) and its sections
# agree.
