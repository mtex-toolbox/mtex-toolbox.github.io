# # Theory of Misorientations
#
# An [orientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationDefinition_py.html) says how one crystal sits in the specimen. A
# *misorientation* says how two crystals sit relative to each other. It is a coordinate
# transform from one crystal frame into the other, so the specimen frame drops out.
#
# Misorientations describe grain boundaries, twins, phase transformations, and orientation
# gradients inside a deformed grain. The two crystals may belong to the same phase or to
# different phases.
#
# This page assumes that orientations map crystal coordinates to specimen coordinates.
# Review [Orientations as Coordinate Transforms](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DefinitionAsCoordinateTransform_py.html) if
# the order of composed transforms is unfamiliar.

# ## The Directed Misorientation
#
# A full misorientation contains an axis as well as an angle, and it has a direction.
# Since `ori1` and `ori2` both map crystal coordinates to specimen coordinates, the product
# below maps coordinates of grain 2 into grain 1.

# The same population can instead be reduced to its axes.

# ## The Maths Behind the Transform
#
# Let $\mathbf{G}_1$ and $\mathbf{G}_2$ be the matrices of `ori1` and `ori2`. A direction
# with crystal-2 components $\mathbf{h}_2$ has specimen components
# $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{G}_2\mathbf{h}_2$. Its components in the frame of crystal 1 are
# therefore
#
# $$ \mathbf{h}_1 = \mathbf{G}_1^{-1}\mathbf{r}
#    = \mathbf{G}_1^{-1}\mathbf{G}_2\mathbf{h}_2. $$
#
# This is why `inv(ori1) * ori2` maps crystal 2 into crystal 1. Reversing the order gives
# the inverse map.
#
# Proper symmetry operations may multiply this transform from both sides without changing
# the physical crystal relationship. The fundamental region retains one representative from
# that equivalent set. For a same-phase grain boundary, swapping the two grains also
# replaces the transform by its inverse; [grain exchange symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationGrainExchangeSym_py.html)
# develops that additional equivalence.
