# # The Spherical Radon Transform
#
# The spherical Radon transform replaces every function value by an average around a great
# circle. It therefore turns a localized peak into a ring. This geometric change is the key
# to recognizing the transform in a plot.
#
# In texture analysis, the corresponding operation turns an ODF into a
# [pole figure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureSimulation_py.html). This page first develops the transform for an
# ordinary spherical function. See [radon](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcPDF.html) for the
# orientation-space version.
#
# ## From a peak to a ring
#
# Start with a smooth peak centred on the direction $(1,1,1)$.

# The single maximum has become a ring. Every pole on that ring identifies a great circle
# that passes through the original peak. Such poles lie $90$ degree from the peak direction.
#
# ## Checking one transformed value
#
# Let $\vec x$ be the pole of a great circle. The transform at $\vec x$ is the mean of the
# function along the circle perpendicular to $\vec x$,
#
# $$ \mathcal R f(\vec x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\vec v \perp \vec x}
# f(\vec v)\,\mathrm{d}\vec v. $$
#
# Check this definition at an arbitrary direction. The vectors `u1` and `u2` span the plane
# perpendicular to `x`, while `v` samples its unit circle.

# %%
x = normalize(vector3d(0.3, -0.7, 0.5))

u1 = orth(x)
u2 = cross(x, u1)
t = 2 * np.pi * np.arange(100000) / 100000
v = np.cos(t) * u1 + np.sin(t) * u2

np.array([np.mean(sF.eval(v)), rF.eval(x)])

# %% [markdown]
# The direct mean and the value returned by `radon` agree to the displayed precision. The
# spherical transform is the analogue of the classical Radon transform used in computed
# tomography.
#
# ## What information is lost
#
# A great circle contains every direction together with its antipode. Averaging along that
# circle cannot distinguish $f(\vec v)$ from $f(-\vec v)$. The great-circle Radon transform
# therefore destroys the odd part of a function and is always
# [antipodally symmetric](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorsAxes_py.html).
#
# Apply the transform to the purely odd function $f(\vec v)=v_z$. The result is zero up to
# numerical noise.

# %%
sFodd = S2FunHarmonic.quadrature(lambda v: v.z, bandwidth=8)

# %%

# ## Mean values along small circles
#
# A second argument $\delta$ asks `radon` to average along a small circle. Its angular
# distance from $\vec x$ is $\pi/2+\delta$, instead of $\pi/2$ for a great circle.

# %%
delta = 20 * degree

rD = radon(sF, delta)

w = np.cos(np.pi / 2 + delta) * x + np.sin(np.pi / 2 + delta) * (np.cos(t) * u1 + np.sin(t) * u2)

np.array([np.mean(sF.eval(w)), rD.eval(x)])

# %% [markdown]
# Again, the sampled mean and the transformed value agree to the displayed precision.

# %%
plot(rD, upper=True)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The high-value band is displaced from the great-circle ring because the sampled circles
# are now offset by `delta`. For nonzero `delta`, opposite poles generally describe
# different small circles, so `rD` need not be antipodally symmetric.
#
# ## Inverting the transform
#
# [invRadon](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunHarmonic.invRadon.html) reverses the transform in the spherical harmonic
# basis. A round trip recovers an antipodally symmetric function exactly within its harmonic
# representation, up to floating-point error.

# %%
sFeven = S2FunHarmonic.quadrature(lambda v: 0.5 * (f(v) + f(-v)), bandwidth=48)

nodes = equispacedS2Grid(resolution=5 * degree)

np.mean(np.abs(invRadon(radon(sFeven)).eval(nodes) - sFeven.eval(nodes)))

# %% [markdown]
# A general function cannot be recovered because its odd part has already been lost.
# Inverting `rF` returns precisely the even part of `sF`.

# %%
backF = invRadon(rF)

# ---

# %%
np.mean(np.abs(backF.eval(nodes) - sF.eval(nodes)))

# %% [markdown]
# The nonzero first error measures the missing odd part. Comparing with `sFeven` instead
# confirms that the even part was recovered.

# %%
np.mean(np.abs(backF.eval(nodes) - sFeven.eval(nodes)))

# %% [markdown]
# ## The maths behind this
#
# Great-circle averaging is unchanged by rotation. The spherical Radon transform is
# therefore a convolution and acts diagonally on the harmonic expansion. Its Legendre
# coefficients are
#
# $$ A_n = (-1)^{n/2}\,\frac{(n-1)!!}{n!!} \quad\text{for even } n,
# \qquad A_n = 0 \quad\text{for odd } n. $$
#
# The zero odd coefficients explain the permanent loss demonstrated above. For the even
# degrees, `invRadon` divides by $A_n$.
#
# The magnitude of $A_n$ decays like $n^{-1/2}$. Its inverse consequently amplifies
# high-degree noise. Measured data should not be inverted directly; instead, solve a
# regularized problem as in [ODF reconstruction from pole figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html). The
# missing odd part reappears there as the [ghost effect](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFAmbiguity_py.html).
