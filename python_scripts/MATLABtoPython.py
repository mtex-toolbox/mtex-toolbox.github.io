# # MTEX in MATLAB and in Python
#
# MTEX for Python keeps the names of MATLAB MTEX: the classes (`vector3d`, `orientation`,
# `EBSD`, `grain2d`), the commands (`calcGrains`, `calcDensity`, `plotPF`) and their
# options. A MATLAB script translates line by line, and most lines change only in their
# punctuation. This page lists what does change, the rules of the Python language first and
# then the few places where MTEX itself behaves differently.
#
# ## Starting MTEX
#
# MATLAB MTEX is started once per session with `startup_mtex`. In Python, every script
# starts by importing MTEX:

# %%
from mtex import *

# %% [markdown]
# This makes every MTEX command available by its name. The setup of Python and of an editor
# is described in [Installing MTEX for Python](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Installation_py.html).
#
# Comments start with `#` instead of `%`, and a cell of the editor starts with `# %%`
# instead of `%%`. There is no semicolon to suppress output: a line never prints anything,
# except the last line of a cell when it is a bare expression. Use `print` to show a value
# anywhere else.

# %%
ebsd = mtexdata('forsterite')
print(len(ebsd))
ebsd

# %% [markdown]
# ## Options are keywords
#
# A MATLAB option is a name followed by its value, a flag is a name alone. In Python both
# are keyword arguments: the option is `name=value`, the flag is `name=True`.
#
# | MATLAB | Python |
# |---|---|
# | `calcGrains(ebsd, 'angle', 10*degree)` | `calcGrains(ebsd, angle=10*degree)` |
# | `Miller(1,0,0, cs, 'antipodal')` | `Miller(1, 0, 0, cs, antipodal=True)` |
# | `plot(grains, 'linewidth', 2)` | `plot(grains, lineWidth=2)` |
# | `calcODF(pf, 'noGhostCorrection')` | `calcODF(pf, ghostCorrection=False)` |
#
# The keywords are spelled one way throughout: in camelCase (`lineWidth`, `markerSize`,
# `displayName`), a tolerance as `tol`, an iteration bound as `maxIter`, and a flag by what
# it switches on, so that MATLAB's `'noSymmetry'` is `symmetry=False`. Progress output is
# switched by `verbose`, where MATLAB silences it by `'silent'`: `mtexdata(..., verbose=False)`.
#
# A string that names something stays a string in the argument list: the kind of Miller
# indices `'uvw'`, an Euler convention `'ZYZ'`, an alignment `'X||a'`.

# %%
grains = calcGrains(ebsd['indexed'], angle=10 * degree, minPixel=5)
cs = ebsd['Forsterite'].CS
Miller(1, 0, 0, cs, 'uvw')

# %% [markdown]
# See [Options](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GeneralConceptsOptions_py.html) for more.
#
# ## Indexing with brackets, counting from zero
#
# Selections use square brackets instead of round ones. Everything else about them stays:
# a phase name, a condition or a list of positions selects.
#
# | MATLAB | Python |
# |---|---|
# | `ebsd('indexed')` | `ebsd['indexed']` |
# | `ebsd('Forsterite')` | `ebsd['Forsterite']` |
# | `grains(grains.grainSize > 100)` | `grains[grains.grainSize > 100]` |
# | `gB('Forsterite', 'Forsterite')` | `gB['Forsterite', 'Forsterite']` |
#
# Positions count from 0, and a range `a:b` stops before `b`. MATLAB's `x(1)` is `x[0]`,
# `x(1:10)` is `x[0:10]`, and `x(end)` is `x[-1]`.

# %%
big = grains[grains.grainSize > 100]
big[0:3].grainSize

# %% [markdown]
# Positions and ids are different things: the grain ids count from 1, as in MATLAB, so the
# first grain is at position 0 and has the id 1.

# %%
grains[0].id

# %% [markdown]
# See [Lists and Indexing](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ListsAndIndexing_py.html) for the details.
#
# ## Properties and methods
#
# What MATLAB MTEX calls a property is written without parentheses, a command with them.
# MATLAB accepts `rot.angle` for `angle(rot)`; Python needs the parentheses, and without them
# returns the command itself instead of its result.

# %%
ori = ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations[0:3]
ori.CS

# %%
ori.angle() / degree

# %% [markdown]
# Every such command is also a function, as in MATLAB: `angle(ori)` is `ori.angle()`.
#
# ## Several outputs
#
# A command with several outputs returns them together, and they are unpacked by commas
# instead of square brackets: MATLAB's `[ind, d] = find(...)` is `ind, d = find(...)`.
#
# `calcGrains` is the exception. In MATLAB it returns the grain ids of the pixels as a second
# output, `[grains, ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd)`. In Python it writes them into the map
# it is given, so `grains = calcGrains(ebsd)` suffices:

# %%
indexed = ebsd['indexed']
grains = calcGrains(indexed, angle=10 * degree, minPixel=5)
indexed.grainId[0:5]

# %% [markdown]
# Because the map is changed, compare two reconstructions on copies:
# `calcGrains(ebsd.copy(), ...)`.
#
# ## Assignment does not copy
#
# In MATLAB, `ori2 = ori` makes a copy, and changing `ori2` leaves `ori` alone. In Python both
# names refer to the same object, so a change through one is seen through the other. Ask for
# a copy when you want one:

# %%
ori2 = ori.copy()

# %% [markdown]
# Operations never change their input: `ori2 = ori * rot` or `ebsd2 = rotate(ebsd, rot)`
# return new objects, as in MATLAB.
#
# ## Lists of objects
#
# Square brackets in MATLAB concatenate: `[ori1, ori2]`. In Python square brackets build a
# plain Python list, which MTEX commands do not accept as a list of orientations. Use `cat`:

# %%
ori1 = orientation.byEuler(0, 0, 0, cs)
ori2 = orientation.byEuler(90 * degree, 0, 0, cs)
cat(ori1, ori2)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Arithmetic, numbers and control flow
#
# The operations on MTEX objects keep their meaning: `*` applies a rotation, `inv(ori)`
# inverts. For numbers, MTEX uses NumPy, the standard Python package for arrays, whose
# operations apply elementwise without a dot.
#
# | MATLAB | Python |
# |---|---|
# | `a .* b`, `a ./ b`, `a .^ 2` | `a * b`, `a / b`, `a ** 2` |
# | `a ~= b`, `~a` | `a != b`, `~a` |
# | `a && b`, `a \|\| b` | `a and b`, `a or b` |
# | `zeros(3, 1)`, `mean(x)`, `max(x)` | `np.zeros(3)`, `np.mean(x)`, `np.max(x)` |
# | `numel(x)` | `len(x)` or `x.size` |
# | `isnan(x)` | `np.isnan(x)` |
# | `pi`, `degree` | `pi`, `degree` |
# | `for i = 1:n ... end` | `for i in range(n):` and an indented block |
# | `if a > 0 ... end` | `if a > 0:` and an indented block |
# | `function y = f(x) ... end` | `def f(x):` and an indented block ending in `return y` |
# | `sprintf('%d grains', n)` | `f'{n} grains'` |
#
# Python has no `end`: the lines of a loop or a function are the ones indented below it.
# NumPy is imported as `import numpy as np`.

# %%
import numpy as np

# %%
for i in range(3):
  print(f"grain {big[i].id[0]}: {big[i].grainSize[0]} pixels")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Plotting
#
# The plotting commands are MATLAB MTEX's and take the same options. Figures are drawn with
# matplotlib, the standard plotting package of Python.
#
# | MATLAB | Python |
# |---|---|
# | `figure` | `newMtexFigure()` |
# | `hold on`, `hold off` | `hold(True)`, `hold(False)` |
# | `nextAxis` | `nextAxis()` |
# | `mtexColorbar` | `mtexColorbar()` |
# | `saveFigure('map.png')` | `saveFigure('map.png')` |

# %%
plot(ebsd['Forsterite'], ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations)
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=1.5)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Names that changed
#
# A few classes carry the names of the coming MATLAB release, where the MATLAB pages of
# MTEX 6 still use the old ones, and a few commands have a better name in Python than in
# MATLAB: a misnomer, a duplicate or a workaround for a limit of MATLAB. They take the same
# arguments.
#
# | MATLAB MTEX 6 | Python |
# |---|---|
# | `crystalSymmetry('m-3m', [a b c], 'mineral', 'Iron')` | `crystalFrame('m-3m', [a, b, c], mineral='Iron')` |
# | `specimenSymmetry('222')` | `specimenFrame('222')` |
# | `ebsd.opt` | `ebsd.meta` |
# | `loadEBSD(fname)` | `loadEBSD(fname)` or `EBSD.load(fname)` |
# | `import_wizard` | `importWizard()`, or `mtex-wizard` in a terminal |
# | `plotPDF(odf, h)`, `plotPDF(ori, h)` | `plotPF(odf, h)`, `plotPF(ori, h)` |
# | `plotIPDF(odf, r)`, `plotIPDF(ori, r)` | `plotIPF(odf, r)`, `plotIPF(ori, r)` |
# | `calcPDF(odf, h, r)`, `odf.pdf(h)` | `odf.radon(h, r)`, `odf.radon(h)` |
# | `odf.ipdf(r)` | `odf.radon(r=r)` |
# | `hist(grains)` | `histogram(grains, grouped=True)` |
# | `angle_outer(v1, v2)`, `dot_outer(v1, v2)` | `angle(v1, v2, outer=True)`, `dot(v1, v2, outer=True)` |
# | `eq(v1, v2)`, `eqTol(cs1, cs2)` | `isclose(v1, v2)`, `isclose(cs1, cs2)` |
# | `orientation.eye(cs)` | `orientation.id(cs)` |
# | `plotSpektra(odf)` | `plotSpectrum(odf)` |
# | `textureindex(odf)` | `textureIndex(odf)` |
# | `eS.addFeature_singleStep` | `eS.addFeature('singleStep')` |
# | `project2FundamentalRegion(ori)` | `projectIntoFundamentalRegion(ori)` |
# | `project2EulerFR(ori)` | `projectIntoEulerRegion(ori)` |
# | `sR.restrict2Upper` | `sR.restrictToUpper` |
# | `SO3F.SRight`, `SO3F.SLeft`, `oR.CS1`, `oR.CS2` | `SO3F.frameA`, `SO3F.frameB` (or `CS`, `SS`) |
# | `plotx2north` | `plottingConvention.default(north=xvector)` |
# | `quiver3(t)` | `quiver3d(t)` |
# | `loadEBSD_ang(fname)` | `loadEBSD(fname)`, the format from the extension or `interface='ang'` |
# | `export_VPSC(ori, fname)` | `export(ori, fname, interface='VPSC')` |
#
# ## Behaviour that differs on purpose
#
# * **`calcGrains` changes the map it is given**, as described above.
# * **A map read on a grid keeps its grid.** A map whose file stores a regular grid is a
#   two-dimensional EBSD object at once, rows by columns, where MATLAB reads a list and
#   builds the grid by `gridify`. A selection such as `ebsd['indexed']` is a list.
# * **Moving a gridded map keeps the order of its data.** `rotate`, `shift` and `transform`
#   move the positions; MATLAB stores a rotated map anew. `gridify(ebsd, ...)` reorders
#   explicitly.
# * **Unknown options.** `calcGrains` and most computing commands refuse a misspelt keyword;
#   the plotting commands pass unknown ones on to matplotlib.

# ## Where to find help
#
# Every page of the MTEX documentation has a MATLAB and a Python version; the switch at the
# top of a page changes between them. The MATLAB page is the place to look for anything
# this port does not describe yet, and the rules of this page translate its code.
# `openDoc('EBSDTutorial')` gives a page as a script to run section by section, as
# `edit EBSDTutorial` opens a documentation script in MATLAB.
# [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is the introduction to the
# language, [NumPy for MATLAB users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html)
# the translation table for numerical code.
