# # Fill Missing Data in Orientation Maps
#
# A `notIndexed` pixel is a real scan measurement whose diffraction pattern could not be
# indexed. Patterns measured at grain boundaries may combine signal from both
# neighbouring grains. Cracks, pores, scratches, surface contamination, or a phase
# omitted during indexing may also prevent a usable solution.
#
# A missing lattice site is different: no retained measurement occupies that position.
# This can happen when a scan is interrupted or when selecting or cropping a map leaves
# an irregular footprint. Both cases appear as missing orientations, but their
# experimental meanings are not interchangeable.
#
# MTEX can assign orientations to these positions from their neighbours. The assigned
# values are reconstructions, not measurements. Keep that provenance when the filled map
# is used for quantitative analysis.
#
# This page assumes familiarity with [selecting EBSD data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSelect_py.html),
# [orientation maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html), and
# [grain reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html). Reducing random error at positions
# that already have orientations is the separate subject of
# [Denoising Orientation Maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDDenoising_py.html). Filling also cannot correct an
# indexed but wrong orientation. The next page,
# [Correcting Pseudo Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDPseudoSymmetry_py.html), treats one important source of
# that different error.

#
# We first reconstruct grains from the retained quarter of the map. The option `alpha`
# closes narrow notIndexed regions during segmentation; it does not itself assign
# orientations. See [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) for that

#
# [fill](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.fill.html) estimates the missing orientations. Pass the reconstructed grains
# whenever boundaries are known. MTEX then rejects positions outside every grain and
# prevents an orientation from being carried across a grain boundary: a position is filled
# only from the grain whose polygon holds it, and where the measurements of that grain do
# not reach it, the grain's mean orientation stands in. `gridify` first materialises the
# empty sites of the scan lattice as a matrix-shaped map, which is what `fill` then fills;
# it does not change which values are assigned.

# The grain interiors are now coloured. Positions not covered by a grain remain
# notIndexed, which preserves holes along the grain boundaries. MATLAB's `fill` repeats the
# nearest measurement, which leaves sharp patches; the port continues the orientation
# field of the grain across the hole, by the edge preserving filter `smooth` uses.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Filling with a denoising filter
#
# A denoising filter can estimate the missing orientations while smoothing the
# orientation field. Supply the option `fill` and the grains to
# [smooth](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.smooth.html). The `halfQuadraticFilter` used here is a
# total-variation method for rotation-valued data; its mathematical basis is described by
# [Bergmann et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.3934/ipi.2016001).
#
# In contrast to nearest-neighbour interpolation, the filter can create a smooth
# transition between the estimated orientations. It is still an estimate, and the
# reconstructed grain boundaries still constrain it. Neither method reconstructs the
# grains again. The supplied boundaries remain the segmentation model for the filled map.

# %% [markdown]
# The repeated colour patches have become continuous fields inside the grains. The
# unfilled corridors still follow the reconstructed boundaries, so the smoother result
# has not erased the segmentation constraint.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Which data is interpolated
#
# In these grain-constrained calls, both `fill` and `smooth` recover the orientation,
# phase, and `grainId` of a filled position. The ferrite map carries these properties
# after filling:

# %%
list(ebsdSub_filled.prop)

# %% [markdown]
# The properties `ci`, `fit`, and `iq` describe the recorded pattern or its indexing
# solution. The property `sem_signal` is the simultaneously recorded SEM signal. None has
# a measured value at a lattice site created by `fill`. MATLAB leaves each of them as
# `NaN` there, so that a reconstructed orientation does not acquire invented evidence of
# pattern quality; this port solves every floating point property on the same graph as
# the orientations, so the properties of a filled site are interpolated too.

# %%
plot(ebsdSub_filled, ebsdSub_filled.ci)
mtexColorbar(title='confidence index')

# %% [markdown]
# Provenance therefore has to be kept from the ids: a site that was not in the sparse
# subset has no measured confidence index, whatever the filled map says there. Store such
# a mask before filling when provenance must be tracked independently.

# %%
hasNoMeasuredCI = ~np.isin(ebsdSub_filled.id, ebsdSub.id)
print(f'{np.sum(hasNoMeasuredCI)} of {ebsdSub_filled.size} positions have no measured confidence index')

# %% [markdown]
# MATLAB's `smooth` provides a second marker, a per-pixel property named `quality` set to
# zero at every position that had no orientation before filtering; it is not ported.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Filling is not resampling
#
# If all per-pixel properties are needed at arbitrary query positions, use
# [interp](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.interp.html). It transfers the complete record of the nearest existing
# measurement to a requested position. The page
# [Interpolating EBSD Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDInter_py.html) develops that operation.
#
# The requested position must be covered by an existing measurement cell. Thus `interp`
# resamples a map but does not fill a hole. Conversely, `fill` reconstructs missing
# orientations inside the grains.

# %% [markdown]
# ## A multiphase geological map

# Geological samples often contain many notIndexed measurements because of relief,
# fractures, or phases that are difficult to index. The forsterite example also shows why
# phase and grain boundaries must constrain filling.

# The printed fraction is 29.0 percent, and most of that white is speckle inside the
# grains. Some grains are peppered with it while their neighbours are almost clean, and
# 48 percent of all white pixels sit more than one 50 micrometre step from any boundary
# between two indexed grains. The two large white patches are areas that could not be
# indexed at all, which segmentation kept as notIndexed grains of their own.
#
# Each phase is drawn with its own IPF key, so a colour identifies an orientation within
# a phase and not the phase itself. The figure shows where orientations are missing, not
# which mineral sits where.

# The white that does follow the black outlines is the case filling must respect. There
# the interaction volume straddles two crystals, and giving such a position one
# neighbour's orientation would erase the uncertainty that marks the boundary.
