# # Crystal Shapes
#
# A crystal shape is a polyhedron bounded by lattice planes. In MTEX it is both a model of
# crystal habit and a three-dimensional glyph for an orientation. Rotating the glyph
# makes the orientation visible without reducing it to three angles.
#
# This page assumes the distinction between lattice planes and directions from
# [Miller Indices](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalDirections_py.html). The use of an orientation as a map from the
# crystal frame into the specimen frame is introduced in
# [Orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationDefinition_py.html).

# ## A Simple Crystal Shape
#
# Cubic and hexagonal crystals are often represented by a cube and a hexagonal prism.
# Their faces belong to the $\{100\}$ family for the cube, and to the $\{10\bar{1}0\}$ and
# $\{0001\}$ families for the prism.

# %%
# load a hexagonal EBSD data set without displaying its map summary
ebsd = mtexdata('titanium')

# %%
# construct a hexagonal prism in the crystal frame
cS = crystalShape.hex(ebsd.CS)
cS

# %%
plot(cS, faceAlpha=0.2)

# %% [markdown]
# The display reports 12 vertices and 8 faces. The translucent drawing shows the six
# prism faces between the two basal faces.
#
# A [crystalShape](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/crystalShape.crystalShape.html) stores the vertices in `cS.V`,
# face-to-vertex indices in `cS.F`, and edges in `cS.E`. The vertex coordinates printed
# below are expressed in the crystal frame.

# ## Planes and Slip Systems Inside the Shape
#
# A slip system combines a lattice plane with a lattice direction in that plane.
# [plotInnerFace](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/crystalShape.plotInnerFace.html) and
# [plotInnerDirection](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/crystalShape.plotInnerDirection.html) draw these parts separately.
# Passing a slip system directly to `plot` draws both.

# The blue and red patches are two different pyramidal planes. Their arrows make the
# distinct slip directions visible inside those planes. Their role in deformation is
# developed in [Slip Systems](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SlipSystems_py.html).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Rotating, Scaling, and Shifting a Shape
#
# The vertices of `cS` are in the crystal frame. Multiplication by an orientation
# expresses them in the specimen frame, just as it does for a crystal direction. Scaling
# changes the glyph size, while addition places the glyph at a specimen position.

# %%
# compute colours explicitly to avoid an unrelated colour-key message
ebsdKey = ipfColorKey(ebsd)
ebsdColor = ebsdKey.orientation2color(ebsd.orientations)

# plot the EBSD map in the specimen frame
plot(ebsd, ebsdColor)

# select the orientation nearest the requested map position
ori = ebsd['xy', 500, 500].orientations

# rotate, scale, and place one shape above that position
hold(True)
plot(500, 500, 50, ori * cS * 100, faceAlpha=0.5, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The crystal at the centre of the map is the same prism as before. Only its size,
# position, and expression in the specimen frame have changed.
#
# The three operations also accept lists:
#
# * `factor * cS` scales a shape.
# * `ori * cS` rotates it into a specimen orientation.
# * `xy + cS` or `xyz + cS` shifts it to a specimen position.
#
# This vectorization makes it possible to construct one glyph per grain. Grain
# reconstruction itself is taught in [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html).

# %%
# reconstruct grains and smooth only their boundary geometry
grains = calcGrains(ebsd)
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 5)

# colour grains by the specimen direction of the crystal c-axis
cKey = ipfColorKey(grains)
color = cKey.orientation2color(grains.meanOrientation)
plot(grains, color, faceAlpha=0.5, lineWidth=2)

# retain grains with more than 50 measurements
isBig = grains.numPixel > 50

# rotate and scale one shape for each retained grain
cSGrains = grains[isBig].meanOrientation * cS * 0.7 * np.sqrt(grains[isBig].area)

# place the shapes at the grain centroids
hold(True)
plot(grains[isBig].centroid + cSGrains, faceColor=color[isBig], faceAlpha=0.7)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Similar colours mean that the crystal c-axes point in similar specimen directions. The
# shapes additionally show rotation about the c-axis, which a single inverse-pole-figure
# colour cannot encode. The colour construction is explained in [IPF Maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html).
#
# These are idealized orientation glyphs. They do not measure the three-dimensional habit
# of a grain, and their projected outlines are not the measured two-dimensional grain
# boundaries.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Plotting Grain Glyphs Directly
#
# The [plot](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.plot.html) overload performs the rotation, scaling, and positioning
# from the previous section. It scales each glyph by the square root of grain area and
# places it at the grain centroid.

# %%
# plot the grain map
plot(grains, color, faceAlpha=0.5, lineWidth=2)

# overlay one oriented crystal shape on each retained grain
hold(True)
plot(grains[isBig], 0.7 * cS, faceColor=color[isBig], lineWidth=2, faceAlpha=0.7)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The result matches the explicit construction above. The direct call is shorter, while
# the explicit arithmetic remains useful when position or scale must follow another
# quantity.

# %% [markdown]
# ## A Twin Relationship
#
# A twin law is a specific orientation relationship, not just a visually plausible
# rotation. Here two pairs of hexagonal lattice planes define an ideal extension-twin
# relationship. See [Twinning](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Twinning_py.html) for identifying that relationship in
# measured data.

# %%
twinning = orientation.map(Miller(0, 1, -1, -2, ebsd.CS), Miller(0, -1, 1, -2, ebsd.CS),
                           Miller(2, -1, -1, 0, ebsd.CS), Miller(2, -1, -1, 0, ebsd.CS))

# draw the parent and twin shapes together
plot(cS, faceAlpha=0.5)
hold(True)
plot(twinning * cS * 0.9, faceColor='orange')
hold(False)
plt.gca().view_init(elev=20, azim=45)

# %% [markdown]
# The parent and orange twin have the same faces and proportions. Their different
# placement makes the discrete orientation relationship visible.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Constructing a Shape from Face Normals
#
# A cube or prism is often enough for an orientation glyph, but it is a poor model for
# many crystal habits. A more detailed shape starts from the normals of the faces that may
# bound it. Quartz provides a compact example.

# %%
cs = loadCIF('quartz')

# define representative face normals of quartz
m = Miller([1, 0, -1, 0], cs)    # hexagonal prism
r = Miller([1, 0, -1, 1], cs)    # positive rhombohedron
z = Miller([0, 1, -1, 1], cs)    # negative rhombohedron
s1 = Miller([2, -1, -1, 1], cs)  # left trigonal bipyramid
s2 = Miller([1, 1, -2, 1], cs)   # right trigonal bipyramid
x1 = Miller([6, -1, -5, 1], cs)  # left positive trapezohedron
x2 = Miller([5, 1, -6, 1], cs)   # right positive trapezohedron

# %% [markdown]
# MTEX expands each supplied normal by crystal symmetry. For a normal $\mathbf{n}$, it
# retains points $\mathbf{x}$ in the half-space $\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{n}\leq 1$ and
# intersects all such half-spaces. The length of the normal therefore encodes inverse
# face distance: a longer normal moves its plane towards the origin. Only relative
# distances matter, because MTEX normalizes the finished polyhedron.

# %%
# start from the prism and two rhombohedral forms
N = cat(m, r, z)
cS = crystalShape(N)

# report the geometry that actually bounds the polyhedron
nVertices = len(cS.V)
nActiveFaces = np.sum(np.isfinite(cS.faceArea) & (cS.faceArea > 0))
nVertices, nActiveFaces

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# The polyhedron has eight vertices and twelve active rhombohedral faces. The six
# candidate prism faces do not appear because their planes lie beyond the intersections
# of the two rhombohedral forms.

# %%
# move the prism planes inwards
N = cat(2 * m, r, z)
cS = crystalShape(N)
plot(cS, colored=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The prism now truncates the rhombohedra. Colour distinguishes the three face families
# and makes the new vertical faces easy to identify.

# %%
# move the negative rhombohedron inwards relative to the positive one
N = cat(2 * m, r, 0.9 * z)
cS = crystalShape(N)
plot(cS, colored=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The two rhombohedral forms now have unequal face areas. Their angles are unchanged
# because the crystal symmetry and lattice metric are unchanged.

# %%
# add a bipyramid and a trapezohedron
N = cat(2 * m, r, 0.9 * z, 0.7 * s1, 0.3 * x1)
cS = crystalShape(N)
plot(cS, colored=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The small slanted faces break the apparent sixfold outline. The resulting form displays
# the trigonal symmetry of quartz rather than the symmetry of an ideal hexagonal prism.

# ## Habitus and Extension Parameters
#
# Individual face distances give direct control, but adjusting many of them is tedious.
# The constructor also implements the two-parameter heuristic of J. Enderlein,
# [A package for displaying crystal morphology, Mathematica Journal 7(1), 1997](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/Articles/3279).
# These parameters organize the distances; they are not measured growth rates or surface
# energies.

# %%
# take the face normals without individual scaling
N = cat(m, r, z, s2, x2)

habitus = 1
extension = [1, 1, 1]
cS = crystalShape(N, habitus, extension)
plot(cS, colored=True)

# %% [markdown]
# With unit parameters, the constructor derives all relative face distances from the
# indices alone.
#
# `extension` controls the relative extent along the three lattice axes. Raising its
# second and third entries moves the corresponding limiting faces outwards.

# %%
extension = [1, 1.2, 1.1]
cS = crystalShape(N, habitus, extension)
plot(cS, colored=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The changed axial proportions are visible in both the prism and the end faces. The
# legend still lists five input families, but at this `habitus` only the prism and the
# two rhombohedra bound the shape.
#
# `habitus` controls how close faces with mixed indices come to the origin. The following
# sequence changes only that parameter.

# %%
habitus = 1.1
cS = crystalShape(N, habitus, extension)
plot(cS, colored=True)

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
habitus = 1.2
cS = crystalShape(N, habitus, extension)
plot(cS, colored=True)

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
habitus = 1.3
cS = crystalShape(N, habitus, extension)
plot(cS, colored=True)

# %% [markdown]
# As `habitus` increases, the trapezohedral and bipyramidal faces grow at the expense of
# the prism. This sequence is a parameter study, not a simulated growth history.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Selecting a Face
#
# Indexing a shape with a face normal selects the face with that outward normal. This is
# useful for highlighting one face or inspecting its `faceArea`. Supply a symmetrised
# list of normals to select a whole form.

# %%
plot(cS)
hold(True)
plot(cS[Miller(0, -1, 1, 0, cs)], faceColor='DarkRed')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The dark-red patch isolates one prism face while the rest of the habit remains
# available for context.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Predefined Shapes
#
# MTEX includes tuned shapes for common minerals. For example, `crystalShape.olivine`
# supplies the face families and their relative distances in one call.

# %%
plot(crystalShape.olivine(), colored=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The large paired faces make the olivine model tabular. Other predefined models include
# `crystalShape.garnet`, `crystalShape.topaz`, and `crystalShape.plagioclase`.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Physical Meaning and Limits
#
# A `crystalShape` constructs geometry from face normals and relative distances supplied
# by the user. It does not infer a habit from symmetry or crystal structure. Real habit
# also depends on growth conditions, so one mineral can develop different shapes.
#
# If the supplied distances are proportional to orientation-dependent surface free
# energy, the same half-space intersection is the equilibrium
# [Wulff construction](https://doi.org/10.1524/zkri.1901.34.1.449). A growth shape instead
# requires relative face-growth rates. The distinction and the terminology of habit are
# summarized by the
# [International Tables for Crystallography](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/iucr/itc/Fa/ch5o1v0001/sec5o1o1o1o1/).

# ## Technical Details
#
# The vertices `cS.V` are a `vector3d` in the crystal frame and display as its Miller
# indices, where MATLAB prints Cartesian components. A list of shapes is one object over
# `(n, nV)` vertices, so `ori * cS * scale` for a list of orientations is one shape per
# orientation. MATLAB's `{1,0,-1,0}` index cell is the list `[1, 0, -1, 0]`; the named
# shapes are methods, `crystalShape.olivine()`.
