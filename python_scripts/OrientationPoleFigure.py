# # Pole Figures
#
# A pole figure answers one question: given a crystal direction, where in the specimen
# does it point? A pole is a direction fixed in the lattice, commonly the normal to a
# lattice plane. The plot therefore turns a population of orientations into a two
# dimensional view in the specimen reference frame.
#
# This page assumes the coordinate map from [Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DefinitionAsCoordinateTransform_py.html),
# the equivalent directions from [Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationSymmetry_py.html), and the Miller
# notation from [Crystal Directions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalDirections_py.html). The choice of hemisphere and
# projection is developed in [Spherical Projections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SphericalProjections_py.html). MTEX uses
# an equal-area projection by default.
#
# A *reference frame* is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. The plotting
# convention below lays specimen Y upward and specimen X to the right. It changes only the
# screen layout; it does not rotate the specimen or re-express the data.

cs = crystalFrame('321')

ori = orientation.rand(cs)

# ## Building One by Hand
#
# Fix the normal to the $(100)$ lattice plane in the crystal frame. Parentheses denote
# plane-normal `hkl` notation; square brackets would denote a lattice direction in `uvw`
# notation.

# %%
h = Miller(1, 0, 0, cs)

# %% [markdown]
# [symmetrise](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.symmetrise.html) applies the crystal point group to the pole. The
# orientation then maps every returned pole into the specimen frame.

# %%
r = ori * h.symmetrise()
poleCount = len(r)
poleCount

# %% [markdown]
# The count is six. Point group 321 has six operations, and all six produce distinct
# directions for this pole. A pole on a symmetry axis can have fewer distinct directions
# because several operations may coincide.
#
# Plot the specimen directions in a spherical projection.

# %%
plot(r)

# %% [markdown]
# Notice three points on each hemisphere. Together they are the six crystallographically
# equivalent positions of the $(100)$ pole for one orientation; they are not six different
# orientations.
#
# ## The Shortcut
#
# [plotPF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.plotPDF.html) performs the symmetrisation, coordinate map, and
# projection for several poles at once.

# %%
plotPF(ori, Miller([[1, 0, -1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, -2, 1]], ori.CS))

# %% [markdown]
# The first two pole figures need only one hemisphere, while the third needs both. MTEX
# makes that decision from symmetry. It uses one hemisphere when `h` and `-h` are
# crystallographically equivalent, because the other half then repeats the same
# information.
#
# In 321 this holds for $(10\bar{1}0)$ and $(0001)$. The twofold axes in the basal plane
# turn the c-axis pole into its opposite. It does not hold for $(11\bar{2}1)$, so that
# pole figure retains both hemispheres.
#
# The `antipodal` flag identifies opposite poles even when crystal symmetry does not. This
# is a modelling choice, not another point-group operation. It is conventional for
# kinematic diffraction under Friedel's law, but resonant scattering can distinguish a
# Friedel pair. See [Axes and Antipodal Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorsAxes_py.html).
#
# This orientation has the default identity specimen symmetry. If an orientation carries a
# nontrivial specimen symmetry, `plotPF` also repeats the poles by that symmetry in the
# specimen frame. Crystal symmetry acts before the orientation map; specimen symmetry acts
# after it. See [Specimen Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SpecimenSymmetry_py.html).
#
# ## What One Pole Figure Leaves Out
#
# A pole position fixes where one crystal direction points, but not the rotation of the
# crystal about that direction. All orientations that put `h` at one specimen direction
# form an [orientation fibre](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFibre_py.html). One pole figure therefore cannot
# determine a complete orientation or ODF by itself.
#
# Combining pole figures for several lattice planes constrains the missing information.
# That is the inverse problem treated in [Pole Figure Analysis](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureAnalysis.html).
#
# ## Contour Plots
#
# The option `contourf` replaces the discrete markers with a kernel density estimate on
# the sphere.

# %%
plotPF(ori, Miller([[1, 0, -1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, -2, 1]], ori.CS), contourf=True)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# For this single orientation the contours merely spread each discrete pole into a small
# spot; the first family still represents only six poles. For a population of measured or
# simulated orientations, the contours instead show where poles concentrate.
#
# The colour scale is in multiples of a random distribution (m.r.d.). A value of 1 is the
# pole density of an untextured population, while 2 means twice that density. Pole
# densities computed directly from an ODF are developed in
# [Pole Figures of an ODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFPoleFigure_py.html).
#
# ## The Maths Behind a Pole Figure
#
# Let $\mathbf{O}$ map crystal coordinates to specimen coordinates. Let $\mathbf{C}$ be a
# crystal-symmetry operation and $\mathbf{P}$ a specimen-symmetry operation. Every pole
# drawn by `plotPF` has the form
#
# $$ \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{P}\,\mathbf{O}\,\mathbf{C}\,\mathbf{h},
#    \qquad \mathbf{C} \in \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{c}}, \quad
#    \mathbf{P} \in \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{s}}. $$
#
# In this example the specimen group contains only the identity, so the hand construction
# reduces to $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{O}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{h}$.
