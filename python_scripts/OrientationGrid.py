# # Grids of Orientations
#
# An orientation grid is a finite set of nodes in orientation space. Such grids are used
# to evaluate or approximate an ODF, to search for a best fit, and to provide orientations
# to another numerical method.
#
# Read [Orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationDefinition_py.html) and
# [Fundamental Regions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFundamentalRegion_py.html) first. The spherical counterpart
# is [Spherical Grids](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorGrids_py.html).
#
# The nodes should usually be spread uniformly with respect to volume on
# $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, not with respect to the coordinates used to describe a rotation. No
# finite construction is perfectly uniform, and different grids preserve different useful
# structures.
#
# For these figures, the plotting convention lays out the specimen reference frame with y
# up and x to the right. It does not alter the grid.

# %%
import numpy as np

from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')

# cubic crystal symmetry and trivial specimen symmetry
cs = crystalFrame('432')

# ## The Equispaced Grid
#
# [equispacedSO3Grid](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/equispacedSO3Grid.html) covers the fundamental region of the
# supplied crystal and specimen symmetries with nearly constant node spacing. Here the
# specimen symmetry is the trivial default. Both global constructors accept a second
# symmetry. For an orientation it is a specimen symmetry; for a
# [misorientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Misorientations.html) it is the crystal symmetry on the other side.
#
# The `resolution` is a target spacing. The construction adjusts the angular steps to fit
# the fundamental region, so it is not a promise that every pair of neighbouring nodes is
# exactly $5^\circ$ apart.

# %%
equiGrid = equispacedSO3Grid(cs, resolution=5 * degree)
equiGrid

# %% [markdown]
# The summary reports 4923 orientations and identifies the result as an `SO3Grid` with
# $5^\circ$ resolution. An axis--angle plot shows the nodes throughout the cubic
# fundamental region.

# %%
plot(equiGrid, 'axisAngle', all=True, markerSize=2)

# %% [markdown]
# The point cloud has no large empty patch or concentrated band. Its visual density still
# changes under axis--angle coordinates, so this plot alone cannot establish equal volume
# in orientation space.
#
# ## The Regular Euler Grid
#
# [regularSO3Grid](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/regularSO3Grid.html) instead takes regular steps in the three Euler
# angles. The same nominal resolution creates many more nodes.

# %%
regularGrid = regularSO3Grid(cs, resolution=5 * degree)
gridCounts = [len(equiGrid), len(regularGrid)]
gridCounts

# %% [markdown]
# The two entries are 4923 and 24624. Thus the regular grid has five times as many
# orientations at the same nominal resolution.

# %%
plot(regularGrid, 'axisAngle', all=True, markerSize=1)

# %% [markdown]
# Lines and dense bands remain visible after transformation from Euler angles to
# axis--angle coordinates. They are the signature of regular coordinate steps, not extra
# resolution distributed uniformly over orientation space.
#
# ## Why Regular Euler Steps Are Not Uniform
#
# In Bunge Euler angles, the invariant volume element on rotation space is proportional to
#
# $$ \sin\Phi\,\mathrm{d}\varphi_1\,\mathrm{d}\Phi\,\mathrm{d}\varphi_2. $$
#
# Equal increments of $\Phi$ therefore represent unequal volumes. A regular Euler grid
# places too many equal-weight nodes where the coordinate map is compressed. This is the
# three-dimensional counterpart of longitude lines meeting at the poles of a spherical
# grid.
#
# ## An Equal-Weight Uniformity Diagnostic
#
# A practical diagnostic treats every node as the centre of an equally weighted kernel. If
# the nodes represent the invariant volume uniformly, the resulting ODF should be close to
# the uniform value 1. Its pole figures should therefore also be nearly flat at 1.
#
# The result depends on the kernel halfwidth, which is made explicit here. It tests
# equal-weight node placement at that smoothing scale. It does not prove equidistribution,
# measure nearest-neighbour spacing, or turn the nodes into a quadrature rule.

# %%
h = Miller([[1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]], cs)
equiOdf = unimodalODF(equiGrid, halfwidth=10 * degree)

plotPF(equiOdf, h)
setColorRange([0.7, 2.7])
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# On the common colour range used for both constructions, all three pole figures appear
# flat. Their values span 0.93 to 1.02, so the equispaced grid stays within about 7
# percent of 1 in this diagnostic. Flat to within a few percent is what a usable grid
# looks like.

# %%
regularOdf = unimodalODF(regularGrid, halfwidth=10 * degree)

plotPF(regularOdf, h)
setColorRange([0.7, 2.7])
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The regular grid develops a strong peak. Its (100) pole figure spans 0.79 to 2.62, and
# the three pole figures together span 0.75 to 2.62. The extra points therefore do not buy
# equal-weight uniformity.
#
# ## Choosing a Global Grid
#
# Use a regular grid when values must lie on an Euler-angle raster, for example when
# [exporting an ODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFExport_py.html) to a format that expects one. Use an equispaced grid
# when approximately uniform equal-weight nodes matter more than rectangular Euler
# indexing.
#
# A nearly uniform point set is not automatically an integration rule. Exactness for a
# class of band-limited functions requires nodes together with their prescribed weights;
# see [Quadrature of Rotational Functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunQuadrature_py.html).
#
# ## Grids Around a Given Orientation
#
# [localOrientationGrid](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/localOrientationGrid.html) covers a ball around one orientation
# rather than the full symmetry-reduced region. This is the useful construction for a
# local search or a perturbation study.

# %%
center = orientation.byEuler(10 * degree, 20 * degree, 30 * degree, cs)
localGrid = localOrientationGrid(center, 10 * degree, resolution=2.5 * degree)

localCount = len(localGrid)
maxLocalAngle = np.max(angle(localGrid, center)) / degree
localCount, maxLocalAngle

# %% [markdown]
# The grid contains 265 orientations arranged in shells about the centre. Its outermost
# shell is $8.75^\circ$ from the centre, half a resolution step inside the requested
# $10^\circ$ radius.

# %%
plot(localGrid, angle(localGrid, center) / degree, 'axisAngle', all=True, markerSize=4)
hold(True)
plot(center, markerFaceColor='r', markerSize=10)
hold(False)
mtexColorbar(title='angle to centre in degree')

# %% [markdown]
# The red point marks the centre, and colour records rotational distance from it. The ball
# appears as two patches because it crosses a boundary of the fundamental region and wraps
# to a symmetrically equivalent face. Despite that split in the plot, every node lies
# within the requested ball.
