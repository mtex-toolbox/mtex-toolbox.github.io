# # Transformation Texture
#
# Parent grain reconstruction asks which parent produced measured children. This page asks the
# forward question: which child texture does a known parent texture and parent-to-child
# orientation relationship (OR) predict?
#
# The example first transforms one orientation and then an entire orientation distribution
# function (ODF). It ends by showing why variant selection must be stated when a predicted
# texture is compared with a measured one.

# ## Define the parent and child phases
#
# During a phase transformation or twinning, a crystal can rapidly change from a parent
# orientation `oriA` to a child orientation `oriB`. An OR describes the fixed angular relation
# between their lattices. Here both phases are cubic, and the Nishiyama-Wassermann (NW) OR
# relates austenite to ferrite.

# ## Transform one parent orientation

# [Parent and Child Variants](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ParentChildVariants_py.html) defines a variant and derives how

# returns all distinct NW child variants.

# Black points are poles of the 12 child variants. Red open markers are symmetry-equivalent
# poles of their one parent. The repeated black clusters show that one sharp parent component
# produces several symmetrically related child components.
#
# ## Define a parent texture
#
# An ODF is a normalized density on orientation space. Density is reported in multiples of a
# random distribution (mrd). We place a 5-degree unimodal austenite ODF around `oriA`.

# %%

mtexColorbar(title='mrd')

# %% [markdown]
# Each pole-density maximum surrounds a pole of the modal parent orientation. The finite
# halfwidth represents a parent texture component rather than one perfectly sharp
# orientation.
#
# ## Approximate the child texture by sampling
#
# A Monte Carlo route draws parent orientations from `odfA`. Each of the 10,000 draws produces
# all 12 equally populated child variants.

# %%

# The 120,000 child orientations approximate the transformed texture.
# [`calcDensity`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/calcDensity.html) turns that discrete set back into an ODF.

# %%
odfBSim = calcDensity(oriBSim, halfwidth=10 * degree)
print(odfBSim)

plotPF(odfBSim, hC, 'contourf', figSize='medium')
mtexColorbar(title='mrd')

# %% [markdown]
# The lobes occupy the same symmetry-related positions as the single-parent variants. Their
# finite width comes from the parent ODF, while small contour irregularities come from random
# sampling and density estimation.
#
# ## Transform the ODF directly
#
# The direct route passes `odfA` to [`variants`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.variants.html). MTEX averages the
# parent density over the 12 candidate-parent branches. This calculation therefore assumes
# equal population of all child variants.

# %%
odfB = variants(p2c, odfA)

# %% [markdown]
# The direct ODF has smooth, sharp lobes at the locations predicted by the discrete
# calculation. It avoids Monte Carlo noise and the additional density-estimation step, so it
# is the preferred route when equal variant populations are appropriate.
#
# ## Quantify the sampling difference
#
# The texture index, or J-index, is the mean square of a normalized ODF. It is 1 for a uniform
# texture and increases as texture sharpens. [ODF Characteristics](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFCharacteristics_py.html)
# develops this measure.

# %%
meanSampledChildODF = mean(odfBSim)
meanDirectChildODF = mean(odfB)
textureIndexSampled = norm(odfBSim) ** 2
textureIndexDirect = norm(odfB) ** 2
print(meanSampledChildODF, meanDirectChildODF)
print(textureIndexSampled, textureIndexDirect)

# %% [markdown]
# Both means print as 1.0000, confirming that the ODFs are normalized. The sampled and direct
# texture indices are 3.4814 and 17.4509. The earlier page described it as sharper and more
# detailed; the two texture-index values make that comparison reproducible. `calcDensity`
# selected bandwidth 25, while the direct result retains bandwidth 48. The difference
# therefore includes smoothing as well as Monte Carlo noise; it does not compare two
# different physical materials.
#
# ## Model complete variant selection
#
# Equal populations are a crystallographic baseline, not a universal material law. Stress,
# interfaces, and transformation history can favour some variants. To expose the consequence,
# assign variant 1 to every sampled parent. This complete selection is deliberately an end
# member rather than a fitted physical model.

# %%
selectedVariantId = np.ones(n, dtype=int)
oriBSelected = variants(p2c, oriASim, selectedVariantId)
odfBSelected = calcDensity(oriBSelected, halfwidth=10 * degree)
print(odfBSelected)

plotPF(odfBSelected, hC, 'contourf', figSize='medium')
mtexColorbar(title='mrd')

# %% [markdown]
# The selected texture contains one transformed branch instead of the 12-branch
# superposition. Its stronger, less symmetrically repeated lobes show why measured child
# textures cannot be interpreted from the OR alone. A variant-population model is also
# required.
