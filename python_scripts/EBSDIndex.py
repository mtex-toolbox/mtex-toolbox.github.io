# # Indexing EBSD Data
#
# A single EBSD measurement has several addresses. It has a position in a list, an `id`
# inherited from its parent map, and a position on the specimen. On a gridded map it also
# has a row and column. A hexagonal grid offers cube coordinates as a fifth address. They
# simplify neighbour-based algorithms.
#
# These addresses answer different questions and stop agreeing as soon as measurements
# are selected or rearranged. This page keeps them apart. See
# [Selecting EBSD Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSelect_py.html) for phase, property, and region selections.
# [Square and Hex Grids](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGrid_py.html) gives the complete gridding model.

# The summary above identifies the imported map as a square grid. It is already stored as
# a matrix. Restricting it to a small rectangle returns a plain list. An arbitrary
# selection is not generally rectangular.

# %% [markdown]
# This crop came from a gridded map and inherited its linear order. NumPy advances
# through every column of one matrix row before moving to the next row. Here that means
# visiting all x positions at one y position before moving to the next y position. A list
# imported without gridding instead follows the order in which its measurements were
# loaded.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Measurement id
#
# Cropping changed every measurement's position in the list. Entry 15 of the crop was not
# entry 15 of the full map. Its identifier in that parent map is stored in `ebsd.id`.

# %%
plot(ebsd, ebsd.orientations, ipfDirection=zvector, micronbar=False, edgeColor='k', backend='patch')
text(ebsd, ebsd.id)

# %% [markdown]
# The key `'id'` selects by those identifiers. It therefore highlights the same three
# measurements as the list-position selection above.

# %%
hold(True)
plot(ebsd['id', ebsd.id[15:18]], edgeColor='red', faceColor='none', lineWidth=4, backend='patch', legend=False)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Keep an `id` when a result from one selection must be matched to another selection
# from the same parent map. Selection preserves it. Gridding is a different operation. It
# may assign identifiers for the new raster and stores the input identifiers in `oldId`.
# An `id` is therefore not necessarily a line number in the imported file. See
# [Square and Hex Grids](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGrid_py.html).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Position on the specimen
#
# The key `'xy'` returns the measurement closest to a specimen position. Its output shows
# both the selected `id` and the actual coordinates.

# %%
ebsd['xy', 44.5, 1]

# %% [markdown]
# The expression `ebsd[x, y]` does *not* perform that lookup on a plain list; it is an
# error. On a gridded map the same expression means the pixel in row `x` and column `y`.
# Requiring `'xy'` prevents one line from changing meaning when a map changes between
# list and matrix storage.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Square-grid subscripts
#
# Although the crop is a list, its measurements lie on a regular grid.
# [gridify](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.gridify.html) restores the matrix shape. The shape confirms that this
# crop has 7 rows and 14 columns.

# The labels now show `(row, column)` rather than a single linear index.

# [gridify](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.gridify.html) is allowed to reorder a plain list so that dimension 0
# follows increasing specimen y and dimension 1 increasing x. This crop is a special case:
# it already inherited that order from the full gridded map, so its sequence does not
# change. For a general list, use `oldId`, which relates input order to raster order.
# [Square and Hex Grids](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGrid_py.html) works through that translation.

# ## Hexagonal grids

# subscripts applies to a hexagonal measurement grid. The summary below identifies this
# map as a hexagonal grid. It is stored as a matrix from the start.

# its subscripts remain legible.

# %% [markdown]
# The labels show that rows are horizontal lines of cells. Because alternate rows are
# offset, a matrix column follows a zigzag rather than a straight line on the specimen.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Cube coordinates
#
# Offset rows make a neighbour step depend on whether the row is even or odd. Cube
# coordinates replace row and column by three redundant indices, making the six neighbour
# steps identical everywhere on the grid. They are cell addresses for algorithms, not
# specimen coordinates. MATLAB's `hex2cube` and `cube2hex` convert between the two
# systems; they are not ported yet. Every cube triple satisfies $x + y + z = 0$, and a
# step to any of the six neighbours adds one to one coordinate and subtracts one from
# another, leaving the third unchanged.
# [Hexagonal Grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) explains the geometric
# construction and further algorithms.
