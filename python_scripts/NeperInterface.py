# # Neper Interface
#
# [Neper](https://neper.info) is an open-source package developed by Romain Quey for
# generating and meshing polycrystals. MTEX can configure a Neper tessellation, run it, and
# load the result as a `grain3d` collection. A synthetic volume lets us vary morphology and
# texture independently, test how sectioning changes a measured distribution, or prepare
# grain geometry for a simulation. [Three-Dimensional Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3D_py.html) defines that
# representation and introduces selection and sectioning.
#
# A planar section is useful when the three-dimensional microstructure must be compared
# with a two-dimensional map. It is not required for analysing the original `grain3d`
# collection.

# ## Check the external program
#
# Install Neper separately and make its executable available on the system path. Its
# [documentation](https://neper.info/doc/) gives platform-specific installation
# instructions. The preference `neperCommand` names another executable.
#
# The check below keeps this page executable on systems without Neper. In that case, the
# simulation section loads a bundled tessellation explicitly. This avoids mistaking an old
# output file for a successful new simulation.

# %%
hasNeper = neper.init().available()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Choose files and geometry
#
# `neper.init` returns the interface object. By default, Neper works in
# `os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), 'neper')`. Keeping generated files under the
# temporary directory prevents a documentation run from overwriting a project
# tessellation.
#
# The default three-dimensional base name is `allgrains`, and the default two-dimensional
# base name is `2dslice`. Neper adds `.tess` and `.ori`; three-dimensional output may also
# include `.stpoly`. Assign `filePath`, `fileName3d`, or `fileName2d` when these defaults
# are unsuitable.

# %%
if hasNeper:
  neper = neper.init()
  neper.filePath = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), 'mtex-neper-doc')
  neper.fileName3d = 'my100grains'
  neper.fileName2d = 'my100GrSlice'

# %% [markdown]
# For example, an existing project directory could be selected with
#
#     neper.filePath = 'C:/Users/user/Documents/work/MtexWork/neper'
#
# Neper coordinates set relative lengths; choose their physical scale for the intended
# material or simulation. The `geometry` property controls the outer domain. Its default is
# `"cube(1,1,1)"`. Cuboids use `"cube(x,y,z)"`; cylinders use `"cylinder(h,d,numFaces)"`;
# spheres use `"sphere(d,numFaces)"`.

# %%
if hasNeper:
  neper.geometry = "cube(4,4,2)"

# %% [markdown]
# ## Control repeatability and morphology
#
# Neper uses the integer `id` as the seed for the initial seed positions. Reusing it makes
# the initial tessellation repeatable. The default is `1`.
#
# The `morpho` string sets the target cell morphology. The default `'graingrowth'` is an
# alias for the lognormal equivalent-diameter and sphericity distributions below. Neper
# documents further choices under
# [morphology options](https://neper.info/doc/neper_t.html#cmdoption-morpho).

# %%

  neper.id = 529
  neper.morpho = 'diameq:lognormal(1,0.35),1-sphericity:lognormal(0.145,0.03)'

# %% [markdown]
# ## Simulate a textured microstructure
#
# `simulateGrains` accepts either an orientation distribution function
# ([ODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html)) and a grain count, or a list of orientations. For a list, its
# length determines the grain count. With `silent=True` Neper's console output goes to
# `neper.log` in `filePath`. Both the generated grains and the imported example use the
# ODF's trigonal quartz symmetry, also used on the Properties and Operations pages.

# %%
# the Dubna ODF has trigonal quartz symmetry
odf = SO3Fun.dubna()
numGrains = 100

if hasNeper:
  grains = neper.simulateGrains(numGrains, odf, verbose=False)
else:
  tessFile = mtexdatafile('my100grains')[0]
  grains = grain3d.load(tessFile, CS=odf.CS)
print(grains)

# %% [markdown]
# To prescribe every orientation rather than sample the ODF internally, use
#
#     ori = odf.discreteSample(numGrains)
#     grains = neper.simulateGrains(ori, silent=True)
#
# The summary confirms that the result is a three-dimensional grain collection. The
# fallback is an existing example, not a realization of the settings above: it retains its
# stored geometry and orientations. The ODF controls grain orientations, not a
# boundary-normal distribution or a constitutive law.

# The colours encode one mean orientation per polyhedral grain. The outer envelope follows
# the cuboid selected by the simulation that created this tessellation.

# ## Check the generated size distribution
#
# A morphology string specifies a target, not the measured outcome of a finite
# tessellation. Check the resulting equivalent-sphere diameters before treating the volume
# as a representative microstructure. Normalizing by the mean separates the spread from the
# chosen length scale.

# Use several seeds and, when needed, more grains to assess sampling variability. A
# prescribed list of orientations gives one orientation per grain; unequal grain volumes
# mean its volume-weighted texture can differ from the number-weighted orientation sample.

# ## Compare planar sections
#
# The earlier [sectioning example](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3D_py.html) defines `slice`. A slice normal and
# either a point in the plane or its signed distance from the origin specify the cutting
# plane. Here all three sections pass through the centre of the collection.

# ## Technical details
#
# `neper = neper.init()` binds the one interface to the name MATLAB's static class uses, so
# that the assignments read as MATLAB's. The orientations of the simulated grains are
# sampled at random, so the pictures differ from MATLAB's in their colours. MATLAB's `neper.getSlice`, a section written by
# Neper to a file, is left out: `grains.slice` cuts the loaded grains directly.
