# # Pole Figures of an ODF
#
# A *pole density function* is a two-dimensional projection of an ODF. Fix a crystal
# direction $\vec h$ and ask how much material points it along each specimen direction
# $\vec r$.
#
# This page assumes the ODF and mrd normalization introduced in
# [ODF Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html). Crystal directions and their Miller indices are introduced
# in [Miller Indices](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalDirections_py.html).
#
# Formally, the pole density function is the ODF integrated over every orientation that
# maps $\vec h$ onto $\vec r$,
#
# $$ P_{\vec h}(\vec r) = \int_{g \vec h = \vec r} f(g)\, \mathrm{d}g. $$
#
# This integral is the spherical Radon transform of the ODF. It collapses a whole
# [orientation fibre](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFibre_py.html) to one value, so a pole figure is a
# projection rather than a section through orientation space. One pole figure cannot
# determine a three-dimensional ODF, and different ODFs can produce the same pole figure.
#
# Like the ODF itself, the result is a density in multiples of a random distribution
# (mrd). A value of 2 mrd means twice the random density at that specimen direction, not
# two percent of the material.
#
# After background, defocusing, and structure-factor corrections, this density is
# proportional to what a diffraction experiment measures. Pole figures therefore connect
# diffraction measurements to texture; see [Reconstructing an ODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html)
# for the inverse problem.
#
# A *plotting convention* states how a reference frame is laid out on screen. The
# following convention draws specimen Y upward and specimen X to the right. It does not
# rotate the specimen or change the ODF.

from mtex import *

# ## A Model Texture to Look At
#
# The example combines two single-orientation components with one fibre component.
# Trigonal symmetry makes the difference between a direction and its opposite visible in
# the third pole figure.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('32')
mod1 = orientation.byEuler(90 * degree, 40 * degree, 110 * degree, 'ZYZ', cs)
mod2 = orientation.byEuler(50 * degree, 30 * degree, -30 * degree, 'ZYZ', cs)

odf = 0.2 * unimodalODF(mod1) + 0.3 * unimodalODF(mod2) + 0.5 * fibreODF(Miller(0, 0, 1, cs), vector3d.X, halfwidth=10 * degree)

# select three crystal directions in four-index notation
h = Miller([[1, 0, -1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, -2, 1]], cs)

# [plotPF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.plotPDF.html) fixes each crystal direction in `h` and draws its pole
# density over specimen directions. The panels use the
# [default spherical projection](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SphericalProjections_py.html).

# %%
plotPF(odf, h)
mtexColorMap('LaboTeX')

# %% [markdown]
# The two single-orientation components make localized spots. The fibre component makes a
# ring because its remaining rotational freedom becomes a curve in the pole figure.
#
# MTEX draws only the upper hemisphere when the lower hemisphere contains no independent
# information. That is why the first two pole figures use one disc while the third uses
# two.

# %% [markdown]
# ## When the Two Hemispheres Differ
#
# The `complete` flag displays both hemispheres for every direction. It changes the
# displayed region; it does not symmetrize the pole density or restore information lost
# by the projection.

# %%
plotPF(odf, h, complete=True)
mtexColorMap('LaboTeX')

# %% [markdown]
# The upper and lower hemispheres agree in exactly three situations:
#
# * the crystal direction $\vec h$ is symmetrically equivalent to $-\vec h$ - true here
#   for $(10\bar10)$ and the c-axis $(0001)$, but not for $(11\bar21)$;
# * the crystal symmetry contains inversion and is therefore a
#   [Laue group](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalSymmetries_py.html);
# * antipodal symmetry is assumed, as is conventional for kinematic diffraction under
#   Friedel's law; see [Axes and Antipodal Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorsAxes_py.html).
#
# Dynamical or resonant diffraction may distinguish the two sides. The antipodal
# assumption therefore belongs to the experiment, not to the definition of an ODF.
#
# The `antipodal` flag averages opposite directions. With `complete` retained below, both
# equal halves remain visible for comparison.

# %%

# Opposite points in the two discs now have the same colour. Drawing both discs does not
# make them independent measurements.

# ## Values Rather Than Pictures
#
# [radon](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcPDF.html) with only a crystal direction returns a spherical
# function. Passing a specimen direction as well evaluates that function at one point.

# The printed summary identifies `pdf` as a spherical function. Its value along specimen
# X is 0.1982 mrd, so this texture avoids that direction.
#
# Averaged over the whole sphere, every normalized pole density function is 1 mrd, just
# as every normalized ODF has mean 1 mrd.

# ## Following a Pole-Figure Maximum into Orientation Space
#
# A pole-figure maximum still represents a whole orientation fibre. Find the strongest
# specimen direction for the third pole figure, then inspect the ODF along the
# corresponding fibre with [plotFibre](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.plotFibre.html).

# %%
pdfPeak = radon(odf, h[2])
_, rPeak = max(pdfPeak)
f = fibre(h[2], rPeak)

plotFibre(odf, f, lineWidth=2, figSize='small')

# %% [markdown]
# The line is the ODF density itself, not another projection. Its peaks locate the
# components that this fibre passes through, while their average along the curve is the
# pole-figure value at `rPeak`. This is the degree of freedom that the pole figure hides.

# ## Technical Details
#
# Three crystal directions are one `Miller` list built from a matrix with one row of four
# indices per direction, where MATLAB takes three cell arrays; `h[2]` is MATLAB's `h(3)`.
# `max(pdf)` returns the pair of the value and the direction, so the direction is its
# second element.
