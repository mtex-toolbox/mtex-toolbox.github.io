# # Gridded EBSD Data
#
# Most EBSD maps are measured on a square or hexagonal scan lattice. By default,
# [EBSD.load](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.load.html) keeps that structure: it returns a map on its square or
# hexagonal grid whenever every measurement fits on one lattice. Otherwise it keeps the
# measurements as a plain `EBSD` list and explains why.
#
# This page assumes basic [EBSD selection](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSelect_py.html) and
# [plotting](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDPlotting_py.html). See [Select by Index](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIndex_py.html) first if row and
# column indexing is unfamiliar.
#
# A scan lattice, a matrix layout, and a reference frame answer different questions. The
# lattice says which measurements are neighbours. The layout says which specimen
# directions the matrix indices follow. The reference frame says which axes the positions
# and orientations are expressed in.

# The summary identifies `ebsd` as a square grid. Its 22879 measurements form a 137 by

# ## What a Grid Is Good For
#
# * Per-pixel data can be handed to image-processing and registration tools as a matrix,
#   and `ebsd[i, j]` addresses one scan position.
# * [Plotting](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDPlotting_py.html) and [denoising](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDDenoising_py.html) are considerably
#   faster because the raster does not have to be reconstructed.
#
# Matrix indexing means what it says. The measurement in row 49 and column 99, counted
# from zero, is

# %%
ebsd[49, 99]

# %% [markdown]
# In the default layout, the first matrix dimension follows the grid direction closest to
# y. The second follows the direction closest to x. Both indices advance towards
# increasing coordinates. Thus `ebsd[0, 0]` is the corner with the smallest coordinates,
# and `ebsd[i, j]` is the j-th pixel in the i-th scan row.
#
# This layout belongs to the map, not to the file traversal order. It is the same
# whichever corner the acquisition started from.
#
# A stored matrix is not required nearly as often as it once was. The
# [orientation gradient](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.gradientX.html), [curvature](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.curvature.html),
# [GND](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcGND.html), and [fill](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.fill.html) operate on the virtual lattice
# derived by [lattice](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.lattice.html). They also work on plain lists, phase subsets,
# and arbitrarily aligned maps.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Choosing the Layout
#
# A matrix is useful for image processing only when it is stored the same way round as
# the image. A forescatter or BSE image follows the order in which its detector wrote the
# pixels. That order need not match the map. [Maps and Images](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDMapsAndImages_py.html)
# compares a real map with SEM images of the same area.
#
# `'columnMajor'` and `'rowMajor'` are the two layouts aligned with x and y. Both are
# [gridLayout](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/gridLayout.gridLayout.html) objects. A layout names the row direction
# first, in the same order as the shape of the array. Suppose an image's rows run against
# x and its columns run along y, as for a detector mounted a quarter turn from the scan.

# %%
gL = gridLayout(-xvector, yvector)

# %% [markdown]
# Handing that layout to `gridify` changes the matrix shape and ordering.

# The map records the layout in which it is stored.

# ## Data That Cannot Be Put on a Grid
#
# A rectangular raster is faithful only when every measurement occupies a distinct site
# of one lattice. If two measurements land in the same cell, one would be lost. MTEX
# therefore keeps such data as a list and reports the problem rather than silently
# dropping a measurement.

# %%

# The warning above says why the data stays a list. MTEX also keeps a list when the
# positions are too irregular to span a sensible raster. You may request a list
# independently of the data, either for one import,
#
#     ebsd = EBSD.load(fname, grid=False)
#
# or for the whole session.
#
#     setMTEXpref('gridifyOnImport', False)
#
# You may change representation later. `ebsd.flatten()` flattens a gridded map into a
# list, while [gridify](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.gridify.html) puts a list on its grid.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Selecting a Subset Drops the Matrix Shape
#
# Selecting a phase, region, or indexed measurements usually leaves a shape that is not
# rectangular. The result is therefore a plain list, although every retained measurement
# still lies on the original lattice.

# The variables `ebsd` and `ebsdMg` differ at the 46 positions that were not indexed. In
# `ebsd` those are real measurements in the separate `'notIndexed'` phase: a diffraction
# pattern was recorded but could not be indexed. Selecting magnesium removes those
# measurements and creates gaps, meaning missing sites within scan lines.
#
# After `gridify`, each gap is an empty lattice site in `ebsdMg`. Its orientation is
# `NaN` and its id lies beyond the ids of the parent map, because no selected measurement
# belongs there. It is not a notIndexed measurement.

# ## Gridding Reorders the Measurements
#
# [gridify](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.gridify.html) does not preserve input order, and generally cannot. The
# layout fixes the first matrix dimension to y, whereas `.ctf` and `.ang` files usually
# write x fastest. Consequently, the k-th entry of the flattened grid is generally not
# line k of the input file.
#
# Nothing is lost. The `id` of every measurement keeps its number in the imported list,
# the record MATLAB keeps as the property `oldId`. Its upper left corner shows
# consecutive ids running along matrix rows.

# %%
ebsd.id[0:3, 0:4]

# %% [markdown]
# The index `return_index=True` adds, MATLAB's second output of `gridify`, translates in
# the other direction. In particular, `ebsdGrid.pos` at `newId` returns the gridded
# positions in the order of the input list.

# %%
ebsdGrid, newId = gridify(ebsd.flatten(), return_index=True)

np.array_equal(ebsdGrid.pos.flatten()[newId].data, ebsd.flatten().pos.data)

# %% [markdown]
#
# This distinction matters only to code that depends on input order. Grain reconstruction
# does not: [calcGrains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcGrains.html) returns the same grains from the list and
# from the map.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Gradient
#
# The orientation gradient, the incomplete Nye tensor, and the gradient form of the
# weighted Burgers vector are computed on the virtual lattice. They therefore do not
# require a stored matrix. The default integral form of the weighted Burgers vector is a
# raster algorithm and grids internally.
#
# A grid does no harm, so this example continues with `ebsdMg`. The result has the same
# matrix shape as the map.

# The same principles apply to a hexagonal scan. MTEX imports it on its hexagonal grid
# and provides the same row and column indexing.

# ## Switching from a Hexagonal to a Square Grid
#
# Some external image-processing tools require square pixels. Passing a square `unitCell`
# to [gridify](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.gridify.html) resamples the hexagonal measurements onto such a grid.

# %%

# This operation differs fundamentally from restoring a map's own lattice. The new grid
# sites do not coincide with the measured ones, so every site copies the values of the
# nearest measurement. The left panel shows the measured hexagons; the right shows the
# square pixels after resampling.
#
# The square cell above has approximately the same size as the hexagonal one. Squares
# cannot reproduce hexagonal outlines, so grain boundaries in the right panel are visibly
# staircased. A smaller square cell reduces the size of the steps.

#
# Pixels that remain notIndexed correspond to measurements that were not indexed in the

# ## Rotated Grids
#
# Rotating a map rotates its unit cell together with its positions. The lattice therefore

# ## Robustness to Distorted Grids
#
# EBSD is measured on a tilted specimen. Seen from a finite working distance, the far
# edge is farther away and appears smaller. The measured positions can therefore depart
# smoothly from any single rigid lattice. MTEX still reconstructs the underlying grid
# indices of an [EBSD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.EBSD.html) object. This matters to `gridify` and to every
# operation that needs neighbours, including [calcGrains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcGrains.html) and the
# cell drawing of a map.
#
# Grid reconstruction uses a local deformation model. MTEX first fits an ideal affine
# grid. It then interpolates the local deviation between the measured positions and that
# grid wherever a cell has no measurement. Thus a gap, a notIndexed hole, and the dummy
# cells used to bound the map follow the measured distortion rather than an unrelated
# rigid lattice.
#
# These terms are distinct. A gap is a run of measurements removed from a scan line, such
# as by selecting one phase. A hole is a connected notIndexed area inside the scanned
# region. A dummy cell is a synthetic cell beyond the scanned edge; it has no id and never
# becomes a grain.
#
# The example uses a real map because the failure appears only when the map is
# realistically wide. A small synthetic grid remains safe at distortion levels that already
# misindex a wide map.

# %%

# [transform](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.transform.html) moves every pixel and its unit cell. It leaves
# orientations and all other per-pixel properties untouched. The command takes a
# [spatialTransform](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransform.html), which records the mapping as an object; see
# [Spatial Transforms](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSpatialTransform_py.html).
#
# A tilt is a projective transform. Straight lines remain straight, but parallel lines need
# not, and scale varies across the frame. Three values specify it: the surface tilt, the
# working distance, and the point left in place. `byTilt` tilts about the x axis, so the
# tilt angle foreshortens the map across that axis, along y. The working distance controls
# perspective, which vanishes as that distance grows.
#
# Here the tilt is known and imposed. Recovering an unknown tilt from two measured images
# is the inverse problem. [spatialTransformTilt](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformTilt.html) fits it in
