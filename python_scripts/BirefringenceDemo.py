# # Birefringence
#
# An anisotropic crystal has two permitted polarization directions for most
# light-propagation directions. The two waves travel at different speeds. Their
# refractive-index difference is the *directional birefringence*.
#
# Between crossed polarizers, this speed difference becomes a phase lag. Some wavelengths
# are then transmitted more strongly than others, producing the interference colours seen
# in a petrographic microscope.
#
# This page builds a rank-two refractive-index tensor for olivine. It then predicts
# birefringence, optical axes, and interference colours from EBSD orientations. The tensor
# and orientation conventions are introduced in [Tensor Definition](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TensorDefinition_py.html)
# and [Orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationDefinition_py.html). The distinction between crystal symmetry
# and its frame is explained in [Crystal Reference Systems](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalReferenceSystem_py.html).

# ## Build the refractive-index tensor
#
# The refractive index is $n=c/v$, so a larger index means a slower wave. A symmetric
# rank-two tensor stores its directional dependence.
# [refractiveIndexTensor](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/refractiveIndexTensor.refractiveIndexTensor.html) attaches that
# tensor to the crystal frame.
#
# Orthorhombic olivine is optically biaxial. Its three principal indices are
# $n_{\alpha}<n_{\beta}<n_{\gamma}$, with $n_{\alpha}$ parallel to b, $n_{\beta}$ parallel
# to c, and $n_{\gamma}$ parallel to a. The order in the diagonal matrix is therefore a,
# b, c.
#
# The mmm point group forces the off-diagonal components to zero in this symmetry-aligned
# crystal frame. Symmetry constrains the property, while the frame states which axes its
# components refer to. MTEX carries both with the tensor.

# ## An illustrative solid-solution model
#
# Olivine forms a solid solution between forsterite and fayalite. For this example, the
# forsterite mole fraction is fixed at 0.86 and the two end-member tensors are
# interpolated linearly. This is a modelling assumption, not a composition inferred from
# the EBSD map.

# The rows show why the axis assignment matters. Sorting the three values and placing
# them on a, b, c in that order would describe a different material. The tensor must also
# remain attached to the same crystal frame as the orientations that will rotate it.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Directional birefringence
#
# For a propagation direction `vProp`, MTEX restricts the optical response to the plane
# perpendicular to that direction. The two eigenvectors in this plane are `pMin` and
# `pMax`. The former has the lower index and is the fast polarization direction; the
# latter is the slow direction.

# plane normal. The two printed vectors are perpendicular to that direction and to each
# other. They are polarization directions, not two different propagation rays.

# ## Birefringence over every propagation direction

# %% [markdown]
# ## Optical axes
#
# An optical axis is a propagation direction for which the perpendicular section has
# equal indices and hence zero birefringence. A biaxial crystal has two such axes. Each
# axis is a line, so its positive and negative senses are physically equivalent.

# ## Interference colour between polarizers
#
# An ideal isotropic crystal remains dark between crossed polarizers because it does not
# change the state of polarization. An anisotropic crystal splits the incident
# polarization into fast and slow components. Their retardation depends on $\Delta n$,
# thickness, and wavelength.
#
# [spectralTransmission](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/refractiveIndexTensor.spectralTransmission.html) integrates the
# transmitted visible spectrum into an RGB triplet. Thickness is specified in nanometres,
# so 30000 corresponds to 30 micrometres.

# and its polarizer points along specimen x.

# ## Verify the equivalent direction route

# coordinates. Its inverse therefore maps each specimen direction into the corresponding

# %% [markdown]
# Nearby orientations usually have nearby colours. Rapid changes occur where a small
# orientation change moves a wavelength through an interference minimum or maximum, so
# this key is not an IPF key with a different palette.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Circular input polarization
#
# Setting `polarizer` to `None` selects the circular-polarization branch of the colour
# key. The response then depends on retardation without selecting one linear input
# direction in the specimen plane.

# %%

rgbCircular = colorKey.orientation2color(ori)

# %% [markdown]
# Compared with the linearly polarized map, the circular-input map removes extinction
# caused only by alignment with a particular polarizer. No grain in this map is fully
# dark, because none is viewed close enough to an optical axis for its retardation to
# vanish.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Rotate polarizer and analyser together
#
# Rotating both elements preserves their 90-degree separation while changing their
# orientation in the specimen plane. Run in a loop over `omega` from 0 to 90 degrees, the
# map sweeps through a quarter turn. Each grain reaches extinction when a fast or slow
# direction aligns with the polarizer. The page draws the frame halfway between
# extinction positions.

# %% [markdown]
# The published frame is left at 45 degrees so the spatial colour variation remains
# visible. The animation, rather than this final frame alone, shows that different
# grains reach extinction at different rotation angles.

# %% [markdown]
# ## What the colour model leaves out
#
# This calculation is a qualitative optical simulation. It uses one
# wavelength-independent refractive-index tensor, a linear Fo-Fa mixture, ideal
# polarizers, and a CIE colour conversion. It omits dispersion of the principal indices,
# absorption, scattering, surface effects, illumination, and camera calibration.
#
# Consequently, a matching RGB colour does not by itself validate composition, thickness,
# or orientation. Those quantities need independent measurements before the result can
# be compared quantitatively with a microscope image.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The maths behind the interference colour
#
# For a unit propagation direction $\vec v$, the relevant refractive indices are the two
# eigenvalues of the tensor section perpendicular to $\vec v$. Their difference is
#
# $$ \Delta n(\vec v)=n_{\mathrm{slow}}(\vec v) -n_{\mathrm{fast}}(\vec v). $$
#
# A section of thickness $t$ produces retardation $\Gamma=t\Delta n$. At wavelength
# $\lambda$, the phase lag is $2\pi\Gamma/\lambda$. For ideal crossed polarizers the
# transmitted intensity is proportional to
#
# $$ \sin^2(2\tau)\, \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi t\Delta n}{\lambda}\right). $$
#
# This explains all three zeros seen above: $\Delta n=0$ along an optical axis, $t=0$ for
# no crystal, and $\tau=0$ or 90 degrees at extinction.

# ## Technical Details
#
# The spherical colour maps carry the crystal frame of the tensor, so the port draws them
# on the fundamental sector of mmm, a quarter of the disc MATLAB shows; the colours are
# the same. The sigma sections of the key are drawn without the arrows MATLAB lays over
# them, and the arrows of the optical axes show through the sphere, matplotlib having no
# occlusion. The animation of the rotating polarizer is a loop over `omega` updating the
# map; the page draws its last frame.
