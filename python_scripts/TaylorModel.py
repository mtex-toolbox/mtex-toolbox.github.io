# # Taylor Model
#
# [Schmid analysis](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SchmidFactor_py.html) asks which single slip system is best aligned with
# an applied stress. The *Taylor model* asks a different question: which combination of
# slip systems can produce an imposed strain? It assumes that every grain undergoes the
# specimen strain, and therefore represents the equal-strain limit of a polycrystal model.

# ## Set the specimen frame and strain
#
# A rolling frame is a named specimen frame with rolling direction (RD), transverse
# direction (TD), and normal direction (ND). Its plotting convention places RD north, TD
# west, and ND out of the page.

# Begin with the three predefined bcc slip families. Symmetrization expands them to 96
# systems because both signs of each Burgers vector are needed to represent signed slip
# with nonnegative coefficients.

# For this orientation the Taylor factor is 2.1208. The vector `gamma` contains one

# ## Map the Taylor factor over orientation space
#
# If the strain remains in the specimen frame, `calcTaylor` returns the Taylor factor and
# spin as [orientation-dependent functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunConcept_py.html). They can then be
# evaluated at any crystal orientation.

# ## Map the spin magnitude

# For an infinitesimal strain step, the norm of the spin tensor is the angle through
# which the corresponding crystal rotates in the Taylor model. The values below are

# All but one of the selected directed Burgers vectors fall in the upper hemisphere for
# this $q=0$ strain. The solver uses nonnegative slip amounts and chooses between the two
# stored Burgers-vector signs, so this is the selected shear sense rather than antipodal
# plotting. Changing $q$ changes the strain path and can change both the selected systems
# and their signs.

# ## How the Taylor solve works
#
# For every system $\alpha$, `calcTaylor` forms the symmetric unit-shear tensor
# $\mathbf P^\alpha$. It finds nonnegative slip amounts $\gamma^\alpha$ that reproduce the
# five independent components of the deviatoric strain:
#
# $$\epsilon = \sum_\alpha \gamma^\alpha\mathbf P^\alpha.$$
#
# Among feasible combinations, the solver minimizes the CRSS-weighted slip activity
# $\sum_\alpha \mathrm{CRSS}^\alpha\gamma^\alpha$. With the equal CRSS used here, the
# Taylor factor is
#
# $$M = \frac{\sum_\alpha\gamma^\alpha}{\|\epsilon\|}.$$
#
# The antisymmetric parts of the same shears give the spin tensor `W`. This construction
# is why the Taylor assumption needs enough independent slip systems to span all five
# deviatoric strain components.

# ## Texture evolution during rolling
#
# Iterating the Taylor spin over small strain increments simulates how the orientation
# distribution of a polycrystal evolves during deformation.
# [Texture Evolution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TextureEvolution_py.html) develops that calculation and explains the
# required step-size approximation.
