# # Reconstructing a Crystal Habit with Smorf
#
# [Crystal Shapes](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalShapes_py.html) explains how MTEX builds a polyhedron from face
# normals. This page shows how to estimate the relative face distances from a published
# drawing with the [Smorf crystal drawing tool](https://www.smorf.nl/draw.php), then
# transfer the result to MTEX.
#
# The example reproduces the olivine growth form in
# [Welsch et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egs077).

#
# Notice the broad (010) and (110) faces, the narrow (001) cap and the bevels formed by
# the other three crystal forms. These relative face sizes are the target of the
# reconstruction.
#
# A *crystal habit* is the characteristic external shape of a crystal and the development
# of its forms. The model reconstructed here is an idealized habit, not the measured
# three-dimensional morphology of an EBSD grain. Its fitted distances are geometric
# parameters, not growth rates or surface energies.

# ## Match the Symmetry and Unit Cell
#
# Smorf is a free browser-based drawing tool maintained by Mark Holtkamp. Select the point
# group and enter the unit-cell lengths and angles from the source you want to reproduce.
# For an imported phase, these values are available from its crystal symmetry.
#
# Choose `Crystallographic (Kristall2000)` for the face-distance interpretation. This is
# the convention that transfers to the MTEX construction below; the other choices scale
# the face normals differently.

# The screenshot pairs point group `mmm` with the three forsterite lattice parameters and
# highlights the required distance convention. The same crystal symmetry in MTEX is

cs = crystalFrame('mmm', [4.756, 10.207, 5.98], mineral='Forsterite')

# ## Enter the Crystal Forms
#
# A crystal form is the set of faces generated from one face by the point group. Enter one
# representative Miller index for every form visible in views along $\vec a$, $\vec b$
# and $\vec c$. Start every form at distance 1 so that differences in the first drawing
# come only from the lattice metric and symmetry.
#

#
# The slide sets the published views along $\vec a$, $\vec b$ and $\vec c$ beside the
# Smorf drawing of the same views, with the interfacial angles to compare against. The
# equal-distance drawing in the previous screenshot is only a starting block: at distance
# 1 the (010), (001) and (110) forms do not reach the surface at all. The same six plane
# normals are a list of [Miller](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Miller.html) indices in MTEX.

# ## Tune the Face Distances
#
# Change one distance at a time and redraw the crystal. A larger distance moves that form
# away from the origin, so the neighbouring forms cut its faces back and they shrink,
# until the form can disappear from the polyhedron altogether. Steps of 0.05 are small
# enough for this example.
#
# Match the largest faces and the overall aspect ratio first. Then tune the smaller
# bevels. Smorf does not redraw automatically, so press _Draw crystal_ after each change.

# %%
dist = np.array([0.4, 1.3, 1.4, 1.05, 1.85, 1.35])

#
# The tuned drawing now has the broad (010) and (110) sides, the small (001) cap and the
# bevels of the other three forms seen in the source figure. Only relative distances
# matter: multiplying every entry of `dist` by the same number leaves the normalized
# shape unchanged.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Transfer the Distances to MTEX
#
# [crystalShape](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/crystalShape.crystalShape.html) describes each limiting plane by a normal
# $\mathbf{n}$ and the half-space $\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{n}\leq 1$. A longer normal
# therefore moves its plane inward. To preserve the distances entered in Smorf, divide
# each Miller normal by its corresponding distance:
#
# $$\mathbf{n}_{\mathrm{MTEX}} = \mathbf{n}_{hkl} / d_{\mathrm{Smorf}}.$$

# The MTEX figure reproduces the published habit. The (010) and (110) faces form the
# broad prism sides, the (021) faces terminate the ends around the small (001) caps, and
# the narrow (120) and (101) faces truncate the remaining edges and corners.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Check the Developed Faces
#
# The constructor applies the point group to each input normal. The multiplicity is the
# number of symmetry-related faces in a form. The table separates the area of one face
# from the total area of its complete form.

# %%
multiplicity = N.multiplicity()
areaPerFace = np.zeros(len(multiplicity))
formArea = np.zeros(len(multiplicity))
for k in range(len(N)):
  areas = cS[N[k].symmetrise(unique=True)].faceArea
  areaPerFace[k] = np.mean(areas)
  formArea[k] = np.sum(areas)
formName = ['(010)', '(001)', '(021)', '(110)', '(101)', '(120)']
print('Form   Distance  Multiplicity  AreaPerFace  FormArea')
for row in zip(formName, dist, multiplicity, areaPerFace, formArea):
  print('%-6s %8.2f  %12d  %11.5f  %8.5f' % row)

# The six input forms generate 20 faces. An individual (010) face is the largest at
# 0.13897, just above an individual (021) face at 0.13840. The four (021) and four (110)
# faces have the largest total form areas, 0.55362 and 0.53841. The two (001) caps are the
# smallest at 0.01977 each.
#
# These areas belong to MTEX's normalized polyhedron and have no physical unit. Use them
# to compare relative face development within this shape.

# MATLAB's `table` is a printed loop here; `N / dist` divides each normal by its distance
# as MATLAB's `N ./ dist` does, and `cS[normals].faceArea` gives the areas of the selected
# faces.
