# # Fitting the Orientation Relationship
#
# An orientation relationship (OR) is the rotation that relates the parent crystal frame to
# the child crystal frame during a phase transition. [`calcParent2Child`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/calcParent2Child.html)
# estimates this rotation when only the child phase remains in an EBSD map.
#
# The fit uses misorientations between neighbouring child grains. It assumes that most
# retained pairs are variants from a common parent grain. This page first fits and checks an
# OR, then explains the objective and the convergence of the algorithm. The full derivation
# and implementation decisions are recorded in `docs/adr/0005-parent-to-child-fit.md`.

# Notice the main population at small residuals and the longer tail. Not every neighbouring
# pair belongs to one former parent grain. The default fit therefore uses the best 90 percent
# rather than allowing the tail to pull an ordinary mean away from the main population.
#
# The `quantile` option changes that retained fraction. The `threshold` option caps the loss
# of larger residuals. Use a threshold in degrees only when the experiment supplies a
# defensible angular tolerance; otherwise the default quantile needs no new scale.
#
# ## Compare local and global fits
#
# The `local` option skips the scan and starts the fixed-point iteration at the supplied
# relationship. It is useful when the starting OR is already trusted.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# The printed value is the angular separation of the two fitted ORs. The global solution is a
# good degree away from the KS-started local result and gives the lower objective value. That
# difference is not negligible when habit planes are computed from the fitted relationship.
#
# Nishiyama-Wassermann, Pitsch, and Greninger-Trojano starting relationships all reach the
# better basin on this map; Kurdjumov-Sachs does not. The complete scan is therefore the
# default. The supplied starting OR remains one candidate, so scanning cannot discard a better
# local result. It costs about two and a half times one local fit on this data.
#
# The scan is deterministic. Its subsamples stride through an angle-sorted list instead of
# drawing at random, so repeated fits to the same data return the same result. A local fit
# reaches a stationary point rather than a guaranteed best fit, so its starting relationship
# can decide the answer. Use `local` when refining a trusted OR or fitting many small data
# sets in a loop, where the fixed cost of the scan dominates.
#
# ## The model: child variants determine the observed misorientations
#
# A [variant](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ParentChildVariants_py.html) is one crystallographically equivalent child
# orientation predicted from a single parent orientation by a known OR. For a parent
# orientation `oriParent`, the possible child variants have the form `p2c * S`, where `S`
# runs through the parent point group.
#
# Two child grains from one parent may select different variants. Their possible
# child-to-child misorientations are the following set.

# %%
p2cVariants = p2cGlobal.variants().reshape(-1)
c2c = p2cGlobal * inv(p2cVariants)
c2c

# %% [markdown]
# In symbols, each member is `p2c * inv(S) * inv(p2c)`. This is the parent point group
# conjugated by `p2c`. Conjugation leaves the rotation angles unchanged. Without child
# symmetry reduction, a cubic parent supplies only 0, 90, 120, and 180 degree rotations.

# %%
np.unique(np.round(angle(c2c, symmetry=False) / degree))

# %% [markdown]
# Only the rotation axes depend on the OR. Child symmetry reduces each misorientation to its
# disorientation, which spreads those four angles into the longer list below. The list belongs
# to the fitted relationship, not to ideal KS, whose disorientation angles are 10.53, 14.88,
# 20.61, 21.06, 47.11, 49.47, 50.51, 51.73, 57.21, and 60 degrees.

# ## See the axis fit
#
# The coloured density shows axes of the measured child-to-child misorientations. Black
# squares mark axes predicted by the fitted OR.

isInformative = angle(c2c) > 1e-3 * degree

# %% [markdown]
# Notice that the black squares lie on the main measured axis clusters. Fitting an OR is
# therefore mainly an axis-alignment problem: it rotates the parent's symmetry axes onto
# those observed clusters.
#
# The predicted set also contains the identity rotation at zero degrees. It is produced by
# `S = identity` for every possible OR and carries no information about the fit.
# `calcParent2Child` excludes this identity variant.
#
# ## The objective function
#
# For a candidate OR, the residual of each observation is its disorientation to the closest
# informative child-to-child variant.

# %%
omega = np.min(angle(mori.reshape(-1, 1), c2c[isInformative].reshape(1, -1)), axis=1)

# %% [markdown]
# `calcParent2Child` minimises a trimmed chordal misfit. It averages `1 - cos(omega)` over the
# best `quantile` fraction of the observations, which is 90 percent by default. This robust
# objective limits the influence of pairs from different parents.
#
# The misfit is unchanged when `p2c` is multiplied by child symmetry on the left or parent
# symmetry on the right. Its search domain is therefore the misorientation fundamental region
# of the phase pair. For cubic-to-cubic symmetry its volume is `8*pi^2/(24*24)`, or about
# 0.137 radians cubed. The domain is only three-dimensional, which makes a complete scan
# practical.
#
# ## The fixed-point algorithm
#
# Each observation becomes a direct measurement of the OR once a variant has been assigned.
# If `mori` exactly equals the variant `c2c(k)`, the following product returns `p2cGlobal`
# itself.

# %%
k = 5
c2c[k - 1] * p2cVariants[k - 1]

# %% [markdown]
# A noisy observation therefore votes for an OR near the true one. Averaging many such votes
# averages away part of the noise. One iteration performs four operations:
#
# * assign every misorientation to its closest variant;
# * keep the best `quantile` fraction;
# * form the vote `mori * p2cVariants(k)` for each retained pair; and
# * replace `p2c` by the mean of the votes.
#
# The vote depends on the current `p2c`, so this is a fixed-point iteration rather than a
# descent step. The misfit need not decrease at every step. The implementation therefore
# backtracks whenever a full step does not lower the objective.
#
# ## Why the iteration converges
#
# Write `p2c = pStar * exp(xi)` for a small error `xi` around the solution. A vote from
# variant `k` has error `R_k' * xi`, where `R_k` is the matrix of the corresponding parent
# symmetry operation. One iteration maps the error with
#
# $$A = \sum_k w_k R_k^{\prime},$$
#
# where `w_k` is the fraction assigned to variant `k`. The matrix `A` is an average of
# rotation matrices, so its norm cannot exceed one and the local iteration cannot diverge.
#
# For evenly populated variants, the parent-group matrices sum to zero.

# %%
R = csParent.properGroup().rot
Aeven = np.sum(R.matrix().reshape(-1, 3, 3), axis=0)
np.linalg.norm(Aeven, 2)

# %% [markdown]
# This cancellation follows from group theory. The three-dimensional vector representation of
# the cubic rotation group has no copy of the trivial representation. A martensitic
# microstructure usually populates many variants, so the error contracts in only a handful of
# iterations.
#
# Removing the identity operation gives `A = -I/23` for even occupancy. Its convergence rate
# is therefore `1/23` per iteration. On this map the variant occupancies range from 1.5 to 12
# percent, and the measured local rate is about 0.24 per iteration.
#
# The iteration stalls only if `A` has an eigenvalue with modulus one. That requires every
# populated variant to share a common rotation axis. Two populated variants with non-parallel
# axes are enough to rule this out.
#
# ## What the classical damping factor does
#
# Classical implementations average the old and new estimates, using a weight `alpha` on the
# old estimate. In the linearised error map this replaces `A` by
#
# $$(\alpha I + A)/(1 + \alpha).$$
#
# An eigenvalue `lambda` becomes `(alpha + lambda)/(1 + alpha)`. The damping factor can
# therefore cancel a negative real eigenvalue exactly. This explains the traditional
# `alpha = 1/numSym(csParent)` default. For even occupancy the eigenvalue is `-1/23`, and
# `1/24` nearly cancels it.
#
# Its benefit depends on the spectrum of `A`:
#
# | occupancy | rho(0) | best alpha | rho(alpha) |
# | --- | --- | --- | --- |
# | even over all 23 variants | 0.0435 | 0.043 | 0.0000 |
# | only the 180 degree variants | 0.3333 | 0.334 | 0.0001 |
# | only the 120 degree variants | 0.0000 | 0.000 | 0.0000 |
# | only the 90 degree variants | 0.3333 | 0.000 | 0.3333 |
#
# The last row is the important counterexample. Fourfold operations give `A` complex
# eigenvalues, and a real shift cannot move that conjugate pair towards zero. Damping treats
# oscillation along a direction, not rotation between directions.
#
# On this map the eigenvalues are `-0.238`, `-0.099`, and `0.021`. Theory predicts that
# `alpha = 0.11` would roughly halve the asymptotic rate. Measured from several starting
# points, however, no tested damping shortened the fit. Undamped fits needed 12, 23, and 18
# iterations. With `alpha = 1/24` they needed 13, 24, and 19 iterations. With `alpha = 1/4`
# they needed 15, 22, and at least 25 iterations. The middle `alpha = 1/4` fit had not
# converged at the iteration cap. All runs stopped at the same misfit.
#
# The asymptotic rate governs only the final digits. Early iterations are dominated by
# changing variant assignments and changing membership of the trimmed set. Damping merely
# shortens those early steps. MTEX therefore leaves the iteration undamped and uses
# backtracking for steps that do not descend.
#
# ## Technical Details
#
# The port's fit is the same objective with its own iteration, and on this map it does better
# than the text above says: the local fit from Kurdjumov-Sachs already reaches the lower basin,
# so the local and the global result agree to a few hundredths of a degree, and both have the
# trimmed misfit 7.948e-4 where MATLAB's global fit has 7.957e-4 and its KS-started local fit
# 1.068e-3; the two global results lie 0.22 degrees apart. The scan scores its candidates on a
# subsample, so the start refined on all the data is compared with the winner at the end.
