# # Transparency
#
# Transparency reveals information that an opaque object would cover. Use it
# to expose overlapping markers, combine complementary maps, or look through
# a three-dimensional surface.
#
# An *alpha value* controls how strongly a plotted object covers the objects
# behind it. An alpha value of 0 is completely transparent. A value of 1 is
# completely opaque. MTEX uses different option names for different objects:
#
# * `markerAlpha`, `markerFaceAlpha`, and `markerEdgeAlpha` control the
#   markers in pole figures, inverse pole figures, and ODF sections.
# * `faceAlpha` controls EBSD maps, grain maps, crystal shapes, and other
#   surfaces.
# * `edgeAlpha` controls grain boundaries and other line plots.
#
# Each option accepts values in the interval $[0,1]$. matplotlib draws
# transparency with every backend.
#
# ## Reveal overlapping markers
#
# Start with 2000 orientations concentrated around the identity orientation.
# Project the same sample onto three pole figures, one for each crystal
# direction.

odf = unimodalODF(orientation.id(cs), halfwidth=10 * degree)

# Opaque markers cover one another. The concentrated orientations appear as
# solid blobs. Neither the number of points nor the shape of each maximum is
# easy to judge.

# %%
plotPF(ori, h, markerSize=5, all=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Set `markerAlpha` to make both the marker faces and edges almost
# transparent. Repeated overlap stays dark, whereas isolated orientations
# become faint. The result resembles a density plot.

# %%
plotPF(ori, h, markerAlpha=0.05, markerSize=5, all=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Marker faces and edges can instead have separate alpha values. The edges
# of overlapping markers accumulate faster than their faces. Keeping the
# edges slightly more opaque can reveal individual markers without filling a
# maximum completely. In the fringes the rings resolve; the cores of the
# strongest maxima still saturate.

# Transparency gives only a visual approximation of point density. Compute a
# kernel density estimate when the density itself matters. The final plot
# shows that estimate as filled contours. [Density Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html)
# explains how MTEX computes it.

# ## Superpose EBSD maps
#
# A common use of transparency is to superpose two EBSD maps. Here band
# contrast supplies a greyscale background. A half-transparent orientation
# map supplies the crystallographic colour.

# %%
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('forsterite')

plot(ebsd, ebsd.bc)
mtexColorMap('black2white')

hold(True)
plot(ebsd['Forsterite'], ebsd['Forsterite'].orientations, faceAlpha=0.5)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The result shows orientation and measurement quality at the same time.
# Dark structure from the band-contrast map remains visible beneath the
# orientation colours. [IPF Maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html) explains how a colour key
# assigns those colours to orientations.
#
# ## Make transparency depend on a property
#
# A per-pixel property stores one value for every EBSD measurement.
# `faceAlpha` can accept those values and make each map cell independently
# transparent. This example divides band contrast by its mean and clips the
# result at 1. Every alpha value therefore remains in the valid interval.

# %%
ebsdF = ebsd['Forsterite']

alpha = np.minimum(ebsdF.bc / np.mean(ebsdF.bc), 1)

plot(ebsdF, ebsdF.orientations, faceAlpha=alpha, figSize='large')

# %% [markdown]
# Low-band-contrast pixels fade while pixels at or above the mean remain
# opaque. Pixels near grain boundaries often fade because overlapping
# Kikuchi patterns from two grains tend to lower the band contrast there.
# Local misorientation is another useful alpha value. See
# [Grain Reference Orientation Deviation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGROD_py.html) for that construction.
#
# ## Superpose a grain map
#
# Grain maps use the same `faceAlpha` option. MTEX also weights a grain's
# transparency by its colour. Light-coloured grains consequently become more
# transparent than dark-coloured grains. The `translucent` option is a
# synonym for `faceAlpha`.

# %%
grains = calcGrains(ebsd['indexed'], angle=10 * degree)
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 5)

plot(ebsd, ebsd.bc)
mtexColorMap('black2white')

hold(True)
plot(grains['Forsterite'], grains['Forsterite'].meanOrientation, faceAlpha=0.5)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The greyscale map supplies the variation within each grain. The transparent
# grain colours summarize the mean orientation of each forsterite grain.
# Compare the fine background structure with the piecewise-constant colour
# of the grain layer.
#
# ## Fade low-angle grain boundaries
#
# Line plots such as grain boundaries use `edgeAlpha`. It accepts one value
# for the whole plot or one value for each boundary segment. Here the alpha
# increases with misorientation angle and reaches full opacity at 30 degrees.
# The call to `minimum` keeps larger angles at the valid maximum.

# %%
gB = grains.boundary['Forsterite', 'Forsterite']
boundaryAlpha = np.minimum(gB.misorientation.angle() / (30 * degree), 1)

plot(grains, translucent=0.5, micronbar='off')
legend('off')

hold(True)
plot(gB, edgeAlpha=boundaryAlpha, lineWidth=3)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Every segment here is at least as strong as the 10 degree segmentation
# angle that created it, and four fifths are at or above 30 degrees, so the
# network is drawn almost uniformly opaque. The mechanism is what matters:
# an alpha vector fades each segment by its own misorientation, and on a map
# segmented at a lower angle the weakest boundaries would nearly disappear.

# %%
np.mean(boundaryAlpha == 1)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Look through transparent surfaces
#
# Transparency also reveals the inside of a three-dimensional object. A
# transparent olivine crystal shape shows its back faces through the front
# faces.

# %%
cS = crystalShape.olivine()

plot(cS, faceAlpha=0.2)

# %% [markdown]
# The same device becomes more useful when the crystal contains another
# object. In this cubic example, transparency keeps the slip-system geometry
# visible without hiding the crystal outline.

# %%
sS = slipSystem.fcc(crystalFrame('432'))
cSfcc = crystalShape.cube(crystalFrame('432'))

plot(cSfcc, faceAlpha=0.2)
hold(True)
plot(cSfcc, sS[0], faceColor='blue', faceAlpha=0.5)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Three-dimensional ODF plots apply transparency automatically. A contour
# level becomes more opaque as its value increases. Maxima therefore remain
# visible through lower-valued outer levels. See [Visualizing ODFs](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFPlot_py.html)
# for the available three-dimensional plots.

# ## Export figures that contain transparency
#
# Transparency is kept by matplotlib's PDF and SVG backends, but PostScript
# and EPS have no transparency and flatten it. Export a figure with transparent
# objects as a bitmap or a PDF, for example:
#
#     saveFigure('transparency.png')
#
# See [Exporting Figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PlottingExport_py.html) for format and resolution
# choices.
