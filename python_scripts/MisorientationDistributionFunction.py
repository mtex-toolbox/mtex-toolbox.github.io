# # Misorientation Distribution Function
#
# A single misorientation describes one pair of crystals. A map contains thousands of such
# pairs. Their density in misorientation space is the *misorientation distribution
# function*, or MDF.
#
# There are two MDFs, and confusing them changes the physical question:
#
# 1. The *boundary* or *correlated* MDF uses misorientations between grains that actually
#    touch.
# 2. The *uncorrelated* MDF uses independently drawn orientations, whether or not their
#    measurement points are neighbours.
#
# The uncorrelated MDF is what the two textures alone imply. It is not a uniform
# distribution unless both textures are uniform. The boundary MDF also contains the effect
# of which orientations became neighbours. Comparing the two separates a preferred
# orientation relationship from an accidental consequence of texture.
#
# This page assumes familiarity with [misorientation theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html),
# [grain reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html), and
# [kernel density estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html). The plotting frame below matches the
# specimen frame stored with this data set.

# ## The Boundary Misorientation Distribution Function
#
# First take the misorientation of every forsterite--enstatite boundary segment. The
# displayed summary identifies the mapping from the forsterite crystal frame to the
# enstatite crystal frame and reports 11,751 samples.

# %%
mori_boundary = grains.boundary['Fo', 'En'].misorientation
mori_boundary

# %% [markdown]
# This is one sample per boundary segment, not one vote per neighbouring grain pair. A long
# boundary therefore contributes more samples than a short one. The result also depends on
# how finely the boundary was sampled.
#
# [calcDensity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/rotation.calcDensity.html) estimates the density, just as it does for a
# list of orientations. The `halfwidth` is the angular smoothing scale. A smaller value
# resolves sharper peaks but also more sampling noise.

# %%
mdf_boundary = calcDensity(mori_boundary, halfwidth=5 * degree)
mdf_boundary

# %% [markdown]
# The result is an [SO(3) function](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunConcept_py.html) and supports everything such a
# function does. MTEX normalizes its mean density to one, so values are commonly read as
# multiples of a random distribution (mrd). Its maximum gives the preferred misorientation.

# The peak is 118.34 mrd at $89.98^\circ$ about $(001)$ in the forsterite crystal frame.
# Forsterite and enstatite share lattice planes in this relationship, and it dominates the
# phase boundaries of this map.
#
# An axis--angle section at $90^\circ$ cuts through this maximum.

# The narrow red spot at the middle of the lower edge is the $(001)$ peak. Most other axes
# in this section have density close to zero.
#
# ## The Uncorrelated Misorientation Distribution Function
#
# [calcMisorientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcMisorientation.html) draws random pairs of EBSD pixels
# without requiring them to be neighbours. By default it draws 100,000 pairs and rejects
# points closer than one percent of the map diagonal. Fixing the random seed makes the
# published example reproducible.

# The summary reports 99,978 accepted pairs. These are pixel orientations, not grain mean
# orientations, so large phases and densely sampled regions contribute more strongly than
# small ones.

# Its maximum is 2.06 mrd, not 118.34 mrd. The preferred boundary relationship is absent
# from independently paired pixels. The boundary peak is therefore a property of the
# boundary network, not something the two textures produce by themselves.

# The maximum is now a broad lobe rather than the narrow $(001)$ spot. The colorbar also
# shows that its scale is about two orders of magnitude lower.
#
# ## The Uncorrelated MDF from Two ODFs
#
# The uncorrelated MDF needs no individual orientations at all. It is completely determined
# by the two orientation distribution functions (ODFs). The ODFs below use the same pixel
# weighting as the direct sample.

# %%
odf_fo = calcDensity(ebsd['fo'].orientations, halfwidth=10 * degree)
odf_en = calcDensity(ebsd['en'].orientations, halfwidth=10 * degree)

# %% [markdown]
# [calcMDF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcMDF.html) computes their convolution. The argument order below gives
# the same forsterite-to-enstatite mapping as the boundary misorientations.

# %%
mdf_from_odfs = calcMDF(odf_en, odf_fo)

# %% [markdown]
# This and the direct estimate describe the same uncorrelated population. Their relative
# difference is

# %%
relativeDifferencePercent = 100 * norm(mdf_from_odfs - mdf_uncorrelated) / norm(mdf_uncorrelated)
relativeDifferencePercent

# %% [markdown]
# The difference is 4.94 percent in the $L^2$ norm. The ODF route smooths each texture
# before convolution, whereas the direct route smooths the sampled pair differences once.
# Finite random sampling contributes as well; the difference does not indicate different
# physical content.

plotSection(mdf_from_odfs, 'axisAngle', 90 * degree)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The broad maximum and the low-density patch on the right match the direct estimate above.
# The agreement is visible in both location and scale.
#
# With one ODF, `calcMDF` gives the uncorrelated misorientations within one phase. The
# displayed `antipodal: true` records that a same-phase pair has
# [grain exchange symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationGrainExchangeSym_py.html).

# ## Angle Distribution
#
# An MDF is a function on a three-dimensional space. Integrating out the misorientation axis
# leaves the one-dimensional angle distribution.

# %% [markdown]
# The boundary histogram has an extra peak near $90^\circ$. The uncorrelated curve has no
# matching spike, although it follows the broader trend of the histogram. An angle peak
# alone does not identify the complete orientation relationship because the axis has been
# integrated out.
#
# Uniform orientations provide a third reference. Their angle distribution is not flat:
# large rotation angles occupy more of rotation space than small ones, and crystal symmetry
# limits the largest distinct angle. This geometry is illustrated in
# [Plotting Rotations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationPlotting_py.html).

# The orange curve is the texture-free baseline, not a horizontal line. The numbers behind
# the curves come from [calcAngleDistribution(mdf)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcAngleDistribution.html) and
# [calcAngleDistribution(ori)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.calcAngleDistribution.html). See
# [Angle Distribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/AngleDistributionFunction_py.html) for their use.
#
# ## Axis Distribution
#
# The other marginal integrates out the angle and retains the misorientation axis. First
# consider the boundary misorientations.

# Their axes form a narrow maximum at $(001)$, consistent with the full MDF. The

# The broad lobe covers much of the symmetry sector rather than collapsing onto the boundary
# relationship. The marginal is itself a spherical function, returned by
# [calcAxisDistribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcAxisDistribution.html).
