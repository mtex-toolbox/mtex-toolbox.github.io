# # Sharp Color Keys
#
# A colour key that covers the full orientation range can hide changes of only a few
# degrees. A *sharp* colour key spends more of its colour range on the small orientation
# range occupied by the data.
#
# Sharpening changes only the display. It does not change the measured orientations,
# improve their angular precision, or denoise the map. [IPF Maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html)
# introduces inverse pole figure colour keys. The examples below also assume that the
# data's [reference frame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) has already been checked.
#
# The first example is a calcite scan stored on a 301-by-151 grid, or 45451 grid
# positions. It contains 20119 indexed calcite measurements, 32 `notIndexed`
# measurements, and 25300 padding positions with no measurement. Padding and the
# `notIndexed` phase are not the same. The lattice of the positions is turned by 45 degrees
# against the map, so its grid is closed by padding far outside the measured box; the
# extent, the phase counts and the plots leave the padding out.

# The printed summary distinguishes the measurements from the grid size. The key display
# states which specimen direction it colours. The map is nearly one shade of green. Faint
# diagonal bands and a few red pixels are visible, but the default key cannot resolve
# most differences.
#
# An IPF colour represents one selected specimen direction, not a complete orientation.
# Equal colours therefore do not prove equal orientations.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Colouring by one number
#
# The most direct approach is to colour one scalar quantity. Here `r` is the specimen
# direction $(1,0,1)$. Applying the inverse orientations maps it into crystal directions
# `h`, which are then reduced by crystal symmetry to the fundamental sector.

# %%
r = vector3d(1, 0, 1)

# map the specimen direction into the crystal frame
h = inv(ebsd.orientations) * r
h = projectIntoFundamentalRegion(h)

# use its azimuth in degrees as the colour value, between -180 and 180 as MATLAB counts it
color = (h.rho / degree + 180) % 360 - 180

plotIPF(ebsd.orientations, color, r, markerSize=3, grid=True, all=True)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The azimuth has a median of -22 degrees. The central 98% of the measurements lie
# between -24 and -18 degrees, while a thin tail reaches -42 degrees. That tail sets the
# automatic colour range and leaves little contrast for the main cloud.
#
# Restricting the range to the main cloud restores the contrast. Values outside it are
# clipped to an end colour, so both ends are changed to purple to mark them explicitly as
# outliers.

# %%
setColorRange([-25, -14])

# mark values outside the displayed range
cmap = mtexColormap('viridis').with_extremes(over=(1, 0, 1), under=(1, 0, 1))
mtexColorMap(cmap)

# %% [markdown]
# The main cloud now spans the colour bar, while the separated tail is purple. Azimuth is
# a circular coordinate, so this scalar view is useful only while the cluster stays away
# from its wrap-around discontinuity.
#
# The same values and colour range can now be drawn at their map positions.

# %%
plot(ebsd, color)

setColorRange([-25, -14])
mtexColorMap(cmap)

# %% [markdown]
# What was one flat hue is now a map of sharp diagonal lamellae. The purple pixels
# scattered over the map belong to the tail of the distribution. This view displays
# azimuth only and discards the other orientation information.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Sharpening the inverse pole figure key
#
# A sharp IPF key keeps the two-dimensional inverse pole figure representation. Two
# settings place its steep colour transition around the data: the mean maps to the white
# centre, and `maxAngle` sets the angular distance at which the selected IPF direction
# reaches full colour.
#
# This example deliberately uses calcite's proper group, `321`, instead of its Laue
# group, `-3m`. That changes which crystal directions are treated as equivalent; it is a
# symmetry choice, not part of sharpening. Use the proper group only when that
# distinction is intended, as explained in
# [Laue or enantiomorphic symmetry groups](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html).

# %%
ipfKey = ipfHSVKey(ebsd.CS.properGroup())

# map the robust mean orientation to the white centre
meanOri = mean(ebsd.orientations, robust=True)
ipfKey.ipfDirection = meanOri * ipfKey.whiteCenter

plot(ebsd, ipfKey.orientation2color(ebsd.orientations))

# %% [markdown]
# Almost everything is grey because most selected IPF directions lie near the white
# centre. The few distant measurements appear dark. Half the measurements are within 2.6
# degrees in disorientation from the robust mean, which confirms that the orientation
# range itself is small.

# %%
ipfKey.maxAngle = 7.5 * degree
plot(ebsd, ipfKey.orientation2color(ebsd.orientations))

# %% [markdown]
# White still represents the mean. A selected IPF direction becomes more saturated as it
# moves away from the white centre, and it saturates at `maxAngle`. A smaller value gives
# more contrast but also makes more measurements indistinguishable at full saturation, so
# it is worth varying this setting.
#
# Drawing the key and ten sampled orientations shows where the contrast was placed.

# %% [markdown]
# The ten orientations form a tight cloud around the white centre. The transition from
# white to full colour occurs in the same small region. This is the whole trick: the
# steep part of the key lies where the data is.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The axis-angle colour key
#
# The `axisAngleColorKey` answers a different question. It colours the deviation from a
# reference orientation: hue represents the disorientation axis and saturation
# represents the disorientation angle. This uses all three parameters of the deviation
# rather than one IPF direction.
#
# A useful reference is each grain's mean orientation. A *grain* is a phase-homogeneous,
# spatially connected region of EBSD measurements produced by segmentation.
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) explains that step.

# %% [markdown]
# The segmentation threshold is 1.5 degrees, far below the commonly used 10 degrees. It
# separates the small changes that this page is intended to reveal. The resulting
# colours therefore depend on both this segmentation and the grain means; colours in
# different grains are not absolute orientation colours.

# This image locates the variation but does not quantify the complete orientation
# deviation. [Grain Reference Orientation Deviation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGROD_py.html) computes the full

# %% [markdown]
# ## Choosing a sharp view
#
# Use a clipped scalar map when one coordinate has a direct interpretation and its
# circular discontinuity is safely outside the data. Use a sharp IPF key when variation
# of one specimen direction is the question. Use an axis-angle key when the full
# deviation from a chosen reference matters.
#
# In every case, state the centre, range, symmetry, and reference orientations. Without
# them, colours from different maps are not quantitatively comparable.
