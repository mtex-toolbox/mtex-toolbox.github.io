# # The Tangent Space on the Rotation Group
#
# A tangent vector describes an instantaneous change of a rotation: the direction in which
# the rotation changes and the rate of that change. It is attached to one rotation $R$,
# called its base point. The collection of all tangent vectors attached to $R$ is the
# *tangent space* at $R$.
#
# This page assumes the active rotations introduced in
# [Defining Rotations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationDefinition_py.html) and the multiplication order explained in
# [Calculating with Rotations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationOperations_py.html).
# [Spin Tensors](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationSpinTensor_py.html) develops the continuum-mechanics interpretation
# of an instantaneous rotation.
#
# Tangent vectors provide local, three-component coordinates for the curved rotation group
# SO(3). MTEX uses them for derivatives, gradients, and vector fields on SO(3), and for
# finite updates through the exponential map.

# ## Left and Right Representations
#
# A tangent vector at $R$ is a $3 \times 3$ matrix, but it can be described by only three
# numbers. Those numbers form a skew-symmetric matrix $S$. The skew-symmetric matrix can
# multiply $R$ from the left or from the right:
#
# $$ T = S_{\rm left} R = R S_{\rm right}. $$
#
# These are two coordinate representations of the same tangent vector, not two different
# tangent spaces. In MTEX the left coordinates are expressed in the specimen frame and the
# right coordinates in the crystal frame.

# %%
R = rotation.byAxisAngle(vector3d.X, 20 * degree)
SLeft = spinTensor(vector3d(0, 0, 1))
SRight = spinTensor(vector3d(0, np.sin(20 * degree), np.cos(20 * degree)))

# %%
tangentLeft = SLeft.M @ R.matrix()
tangentRight = R.matrix() @ SRight.M

# %%
np.max(np.abs(tangentLeft - tangentRight))

# %% [markdown]
# The residual is at round-off level, so both products describe the same tangent matrix.
# The coordinates in `SLeft` and `SRight` differ because their bases differ.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Tangent Vectors in MTEX
#
# MTEX stores the coordinates, the base point, and the left or right representation in an
# [SO3TangentVector](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3TangentVector.SO3TangentVector.html). The base point is an
# orientation, so it is also the single source of any crystal and specimen symmetries
# carried by the tangent vector.

# %%
components = 0.2 * vector3d(1, 2, 3)
vLeft = SO3TangentVector(components, R)
vLeft

# %% [markdown]
# The display identifies `vLeft` as a left vector and prints its three specimen-frame
# coordinates. The default representation is left.
#
# A tangent vector is drawn as an arrow attached to its base point.

# %%
plot(R, 'axisAngle', markerFaceColor='red')
plt.gca().set_axis_off()
hold(True)
quiver3d(vLeft, lineWidth=3, maxHeadSize=4)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The red marker is the base rotation $R$. The blue arrow is a local direction at that
# point, not a second rotation in the surrounding space. Moving the same three coordinates
# to another base point would therefore define a different tangent vector.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Changing Representation
#
# Giving the same coordinates to the right-vector constructor does not convert `vLeft`.
# It defines a different tangent vector whose coordinates happen to be the same numbers.

# %%
vSameCoordinates = SO3TangentVector(components, R, 'right')
vSameCoordinates

# %% [markdown]
# The `right` label in the display is the essential difference. To express `vLeft` itself
# in right coordinates, use [right](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3TangentVector.right.html).

# %%
vRight = right(vLeft)
vRight

# %% [markdown]
# The transformed coordinates differ from those of `vLeft`, while the base point and the
# geometric tangent vector stay fixed. The inverse conversion returns to the original
# coordinates.

# %%
vLeftAgain = left(vRight)
norm(vLeftAgain - vLeft)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Computing with Tangent Vectors
#
# MTEX converts compatible tangent vectors to a common representation before performing
# arithmetic. Thus adding `vLeft` to its right-coordinate representation gives twice the
# original vector.

# %%
vLeft + vRight

# %% [markdown]
# The following operations are available for tangent vectors `v1` and `v2` at the same
# base point:
#
# * sums, differences, scaling, and division
# * inner products with [dot(v1,v2)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3TangentVector.dot.html)
# * cross products with [cross(v1,v2)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3TangentVector.cross.html)
# * lengths with [norm(v1)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.norm.html)
# * normalization with [normalize(v1)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.normalize.html)
# * averages with [mean(v1)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3TangentVector.mean.html)
#
# The last three operations use the vector operations inherited by `SO3TangentVector`.
# Arithmetic is defined only for tangent vectors at the same base point and with
# compatible symmetries.

# ## Exponential and Logarithm Maps
#
# The exponential map follows a tangent direction for the finite angular step stored in
# the vector norm. It returns the endpoint on SO(3).

# %%
R2 = exp(vLeft)

# %% [markdown]
# The logarithm map reverses this construction. Given the endpoint first and the base
# point second, [log](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/quaternion.log.html) returns the tangent vector at the base point
# that leads to the endpoint.

# %%
vBack = log(R2, R)
norm(vBack - vLeft)

# %% [markdown]
# The displayed residual confirms the round trip to numerical precision. Rotation
# logarithms use a principal branch. At a relative angle of $180^\circ$ the rotation axis,
# and therefore the logarithm, is not unique.
#
# Together, `log` and `exp` let an algorithm compute a local change in a flat tangent
# space and apply that change back on the curved rotation group. This is the pattern
# behind interpolation, averaging, and optimization of rotations.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Maths Behind the Two Representations
#
# The tangent space at $R$ is
#
# $$ T_R SO(3) = \{S R \mid S=-S^T\} = \{R S \mid S=-S^T\}. $$
#
# The set of skew-symmetric matrices is the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Therefore the
# two equal descriptions are also written $\mathfrak{so}(3)R$ and $R\mathfrak{so}(3)$.
# Equating the tangent matrices gives the coordinate change
#
# $$ S_{\rm right}=R^{-1}S_{\rm left}R. $$
#
# The methods `right` and `left` apply this change of basis. They do not move the base
# point or change the geometric tangent vector.

# ## Technical Details
#
# A tangent vector stores its components, its side and its reference, nothing else; the
# frame it is written in is read off the reference. The side is the string `'left'` or
# `'right'` where MATLAB names `SO3TangentSpace.leftVector` and `rightVector`. The
# `spinTensor` of a vector is the tensor of the tensors layer, its matrix `S.M`.
