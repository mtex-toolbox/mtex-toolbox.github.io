# # Calculating with Rotations
#
# This page assumes the directions introduced in
# [Defining Three-Dimensional Vectors](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorDefinition_py.html) and the active rotations
# introduced in [Defining Rotations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationDefinition_py.html).
#
# A reference frame is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. The rotations
# below move objects within one reference frame. They do not perform a frame change, which
# re-expresses the same physical object in a different reference frame without moving it.
#
# The examples use proper rotations. Reflections and inversions are covered in
# [Improper Rotations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationImproper_py.html).

# ## Rotating a Direction
#
# The product `rot * v` actively turns the direction `v` by `rot`.

# %%
rot = rotation.byEuler(90 * degree, 90 * degree, 0 * degree, 'Bunge')

# %% [markdown]

# %%
v = rot * vector3d.X
v

# %% [markdown]
# The grey arrows are the specimen axes. The black arrow is X before the rotation, and the
# red arrow is its image.

arrow3d(1.2 * cat(vector3d.X, vector3d.Y, vector3d.Z), faceColor=[.75, .75, .75])
hold(True)
arrow3d(1.05 * vector3d.X, faceColor='black')
arrow3d(1.05 * v, faceColor='red')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The red arrow coincides with Y, so this rotation sends X to Y. The inverse rotation,
# `inv(rot) * v` (MATLAB's `rot \ v`), returns the direction to X.

# %%
inv(rot) * v

# %% [markdown]
# ## Composing Rotations
#
# Multiplication composes rotations. The rotation on the right acts first, just as it
# does in matrix multiplication.

# %%
rot1 = rotation.byEuler(90 * degree, 0, 0, 'Bunge')
rot2 = rotation.byEuler(0, 60 * degree, 0, 'Bunge')

# %%
rot = rot2 * rot1

# %% [markdown]
# The order matters. [==](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/quaternion.eq.html) tests rotation equality within an angular
# tolerance, rather than comparing printed Euler angles. Reversing these two rotations does
# not give the same result.

# %%
rot2 * rot1 == rot1 * rot2

# %% [markdown]
# Their angular separation is 82.8192 degrees.

# %%
angle(rot2 * rot1, rot1 * rot2) / degree

# %% [markdown]
# The black arrow below is one starting direction. The red arrow results from `rot1`
# followed by `rot2`, while the blue arrow shows the reverse order.

# %%
startDirection = normalize(vector3d(1, 1, 1))
forwardDirection = rot2 * (rot1 * startDirection)
reverseDirection = rot1 * (rot2 * startDirection)

# %%
arrow3d(1.2 * cat(vector3d.X, vector3d.Y, vector3d.Z), faceColor=[.75, .75, .75])
hold(True)
arrow3d(1.05 * startDirection, faceColor='black')
arrow3d(1.05 * forwardDirection, faceColor='red')
arrow3d(1.05 * reverseDirection, faceColor='blue')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The separated red and blue arrows make the noncommutativity visible. Parentheses are
# useful whenever the intended order might otherwise be misread.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Axis and Angle
#
# [angle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/quaternion.angle.html) and [axis](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/quaternion.axis.html) read the axis--angle
# description from the composed rotation, however it was built.

# %%
rot.angle() / degree

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
rot.axis()

# %% [markdown]
# The composite is a 104.4775 degree turn about the displayed axis. This is not the sum of
# the two input angles because rotations about different axes do not add like vectors.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Inverse Rotation
#
# [inv](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/quaternion.inv.html) reverses a rotation. For a nonzero turn below 180 degrees,
# the inverse has the opposite axis and the same canonical, nonnegative angle.

# %%
invRot = inv(rot)

# %%
cat(rot.axis(), invRot.axis())

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
np.array([rot.angle(), invRot.angle()]) / degree

# %% [markdown]
# A rotation multiplied by its inverse is the identity. This is why `inv(rot) * v` undoes
# `rot * v`.

# %%
rot * invRot

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Angle Between Two Rotations
#
# The relative rotation below acts after `rot1` and carries its result to the result of
# `rot`. Its principal angle is the angular distance between the two rotations.

# %%
relativeRot = rot * inv(rot1)

# %%
np.array([relativeRot.angle(), angle(rot, rot1)]) / degree

# %% [markdown]
# Both entries are 60 degrees. The second is the direct [angle(rot,rot1)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/quaternion.angle.html)
# call, so there is usually no need to construct the relative rotation explicitly.
#
# This angular distance is used throughout MTEX to compare a fit with a measurement and to
# quantify orientation variation. For orientations it additionally minimizes over
# symmetry-equivalent descriptions, as explained in
# [Orientation Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationSymmetry_py.html).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Lists of Rotations
#
# MTEX objects are vectorized. If both operands are non-scalar, `*` pairs corresponding
# entries by NumPy broadcasting; a column of rotations times a row of directions forms
# every combination. A scalar operand is applied to the whole list.

# %%
rotations = rotation.byAxisAngle(vector3d.Z, np.array([0, 30, 60]) * degree)
directions = cat(vector3d.X, vector3d.Y, vector3d.Z)

# %%
(rotations * directions).shape

# %% [markdown]
# The elementwise result has three entries: one output for each pair.

# %%
(rotations.reshape(-1, 1) * directions).shape

# %% [markdown]
# The outer result has size 3-by-3: every rotation was applied to every direction. The
# same distinction applies when two rotation lists are composed.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading Other Parametrisations
#
# A rotation can be inspected in any representation, regardless of how it was
# constructed.

# composite rotation. See [Rotation Representations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationRepresentations_py.html) before

# ## The Maths Behind the Angular Distance
#
# For rotations $r_1$ and $r_2$, MTEX uses the principal angle of a relative rotation:
#
# $$ d(r_1,r_2) = \mathop{\rm angle}(r_2 r_1^{-1}) = \mathop{\rm angle}(r_1^{-1}r_2). $$
#
# The two relative rotations generally have different axes, but they have the same angle.
# The distance is unchanged if the same rotation is composed onto both inputs from the
# left or from the right. This invariance is why the 60 degree result above does not
# depend on the starting orientation `rot1`.

#
# Sets of rotations are drawn in [Plotting](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationPlotting_py.html). A rotation that maps
# crystal coordinates into specimen coordinates and carries crystal symmetry is an
# [orientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationDefinition_py.html).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Technical Details
#
# Python has no `\` operator, so the inverse rotation is applied as `inv(rot) * v`. The
# product of two lists follows NumPy broadcasting: MATLAB's `.*` is `*` on lists of one
# shape, MATLAB's outer `*` is a column times a row.
