# # Defining Tensorial Properties
#
# A material property is anisotropic when its response depends on direction.
# A tensor stores that directional dependence and relates physical quantities.
# For example, elastic stiffness relates strain to stress.
#
# The *rank* of a tensor is the number of indices needed to name one
# component. In three dimensions, a rank $r$ tensor has $3^r$ components
# before physical and crystal symmetries are applied.
# Rank is therefore not the size of a matrix.
#
# MTEX represents every rank with [tensor](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/tensor.tensor.html).
# Physically specific subclasses add units, conventions, and operations.
# Read [Vectors](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorDefinition_py.html) first if vector components are new.
# [Crystal Reference System](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalReferenceSystem_py.html) explains how a
# crystal lattice is attached to Cartesian axes.

# ## Matrices: rank two
#
# A rank two tensor has two indices and is represented by a $3\times3$
# component matrix. For the stress tensor, one index selects a traction
# component and the other identifies the normal to the plane on which it acts.
#
# $$
# \sigma_{ij} =
# \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
# \sigma_{11} & \sigma_{12} & \sigma_{13} \\

# ## Piezoelectricity: rank three
#
# The direct piezoelectric effect relates a rank two stress to a rank one
# electric displacement through a rank three tensor $d$:
#
# $$ D_i = d_{ijk}\,\sigma_{jk}. $$
#
# A general rank three tensor has $3^3=27$ components.
# Since stress is symmetric, $d_{ijk}=d_{ikj}$ and the last two indices can
# be stored as six columns rather than a $3\times3\times3$ array.
#
# The following coefficients are a compact right-handed $\alpha$-quartz example.
# `doubleConvention=True` says that columns 4 to 6 contain twice the corresponding
# off-diagonal tensor components.

# ## Elastic stiffness: rank four
#
# Linear elasticity relates the symmetric strain tensor $\varepsilon$ to
# the symmetric stress tensor $\sigma$ through the stiffness tensor $C$.
# The inverse relation uses the compliance tensor $S$:
#
# $$ \sigma_{ij}=C_{ijkl}\,\varepsilon_{kl}, \qquad
#    \varepsilon_{ij}=S_{ijkl}\,\sigma_{kl}. $$
#
# Four indices give $3^4=81$ components before symmetry is considered.
# Symmetric stress and strain reduce the component matrix to $6\times6$.
# An elastic strain-energy function reduces the independent coefficients to
# 21 for triclinic symmetry, and crystal symmetry can reduce them further.
# A cubic stiffness has only $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{44}$ independent.

# ## A tensor needs a reference frame
#
# A reference frame is the coordinate system in which data are expressed.
# It is distinct from symmetry and from the plotting convention that lays the
# frame out on screen.
#
# The crystal symmetries supplied to `d` and `C` also carry crystal frames.
# For `d`, the alignment options state which Cartesian axes the published
# quartz coefficients use.
# Crystal symmetry states the point group under which a property is invariant.
# It is attached to a reference frame but is not the frame itself.
#
# Units and compact-matrix conventions are equally part of the data.
# A plausible component matrix in the wrong frame or convention still gives a
# plausible but physically wrong result.

# They are $+1$ for even permutations of $(1,2,3)$ and $-1$ for odd ones.
# This tensor represents the cross product in index notation.

# ## The maths behind a change of frame
#
# The component array is a tensor because it obeys a specific transformation
# law. If $Q$ changes an orthonormal basis, a rank $r$ tensor transforms as
#
# $$ T'_{i_1\ldots i_r} =
# Q_{i_1j_1}\cdots Q_{i_rj_r}T_{j_1\ldots j_r}. $$
#
# Repeated indices are summed.
# This law applies the frame change to every index and distinguishes a tensor
# from an arbitrary multidimensional array.
#
# A frame change re-expresses the same physical object in a different
# reference frame and leaves the object itself untouched.
# Rotating a tensor instead moves the physical property relative to the
# specimen.
# [Tensor Arithmetics](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TensorArithmetics_py.html) demonstrates both operations and
# the contractions that apply a tensor to vectors or other tensors.
