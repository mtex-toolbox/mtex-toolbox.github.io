# # Properties
#
# A property stores one value for every element of an MTEX list. When you select, sort, or
# concatenate the list, MTEX carries those values along in lockstep. This link between an
# object and its per-element data makes a property useful for filtering, colouring, and later
# calculations.
#
# List-like classes include [EBSD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.EBSD.html), [grain2d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.grain2d.html),
# [grainBoundary](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grainBoundary.grainBoundary.html), and
# [PoleFigure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.PoleFigure.html). For an EBSD map, a property has one value per
# measurement point. The expression `ebsd[condition].mad` therefore returns exactly the MAD
# values at the selected points.
#
# ## Properties are not options
#
# A [command option](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GeneralConceptsOptions_py.html) changes one command call. It is not stored
# as per-element data. By contrast, EBSD properties live in `ebsd.prop` and are resized
# whenever `ebsd[ind]` selects part of the map.
#
# Scan-level values live in `ebsd.meta`, MATLAB's `ebsd.opt`. They do not have one value per
# measurement point and are not resized when the map is subset. This distinction is the test
# to use: per-point data belongs in `prop`, while whole-scan data belongs in `meta`.
#
# ## Inspecting imported properties
#
# The available properties depend on the data source. An EBSD file usually contributes a
# confidence measure and an error-of-fit measure. Importers also preserve unrecognised
# per-point columns as properties.
#
# Load the forsterite example and display the fields collected in `prop`.

# %%
from mtex import *

plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('forsterite', verbose=False)

ebsd.prop

# %% [markdown]
# Each property may also be read as though it were a regular field of the object. Here the
# first five MAD values are read as `ebsd.mad`. The map was read from a regular grid, so its
# properties are two-dimensional arrays; `ravel()` lists them in the order of the file.

# %%
ebsd.mad.ravel()[:5]

# %% [markdown]
# ## Subsetting keeps values aligned
#
# Select every measurement whose MAD is below one. The two lengths printed below are equal
# because selecting EBSD points also selects the matching property values.

# %%
ebsdSub = ebsd[ebsd.mad < 1]

len(ebsdSub)

# %%
len(ebsdSub.mad)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Adding a property
#
# Create a property by assigning to a new field of the map. Any name that is not already a
# field of `EBSD` becomes a property, and the assignment checks that the value has one entry
# per measurement. MATLAB requires the `prop` part for the first assignment,
# `ebsd.prop.myQuality = ...`, because it cannot distinguish a new name from a typo; the port
# tells them apart by the length of the value.
#
# This example turns MAD into a quality score that decreases as MAD grows.

# %%
ebsd.myQuality = 1 / (1 + ebsd.mad)

ebsd.prop

# %% [markdown]
# Once the field exists, it can be read or overwritten as `ebsd.myQuality`. It also survives
# indexing. The following values belong only to the selected forsterite points.

# %%
ebsd['Forsterite'].myQuality[:5]

# %% [markdown]
# ## Plotting a property
#
# A numeric property can supply one colour value per point. The map shows lower `myQuality`
# where MAD is larger and higher `myQuality` where MAD is smaller; the colours remain attached
# to the correct measurement points.

# %%
newMtexFigure()
plot(ebsd['Forsterite'], ebsd['Forsterite'].myQuality)
mtexColorbar(title='my quality')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Properties may store MTEX objects
#
# A property does not have to be numeric. Any value that supports indexing can be stored. The
# next property contains one [vector3d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.vector3d.html) per forsterite point. Each
# vector is the specimen direction of that point's crystallographic $c$ axis.

# %%
ebsdFo = ebsd['Forsterite']
ebsdFo.myAxis = ebsdFo.orientations * Miller(0, 0, 1, ebsdFo.CS)

ebsdFo.prop

# %% [markdown]
# ## Properties of grains
#
# Grains use the same mechanism. MTEX supplies derived grain properties such as `GOS` and
# `meanRotation`. You may add any other value that has one entry per grain.

# %%
grains = calcGrains(ebsd['indexed'], angle=10 * degree)

grains.prop

# %% [markdown]
# Store the ratio of the long-axis length to the short-axis length. Keeping this derived
# quantity as a property makes it available for later plotting and selection without
# recomputing it.

# %%
grains.myRatio = norm(grains.longAxis()) / norm(grains.shortAxis())

newMtexFigure()
plot(grains['Forsterite'], grains['Forsterite'].myRatio)
setColorRange([1, 5])
mtexColorbar(title='aspect ratio')

# %% [markdown]
# Elongated grains appear at the high end of the colour range, whereas nearly equiaxed grains
# appear near one. Values above five share the top colour because `setColorRange([1, 5])`
# clips the displayed range.
#
# ## Check the length yourself
#
# MATLAB does not verify that a newly assigned property has the correct length: a property
# that is too short is accepted silently and fails only when later indexing requests an
# entry that does not exist. The port checks the length on assignment, so the mistake stops
# where it is made.

# %%
try:
  grains.nonsense = [1, 2, 3]

# ## How properties are implemented
#
# The `dynProp` mechanism implements the `prop` structure and the overloaded indexing,
# concatenation, and subsetting used here. Classes such as `EBSD` and `grain2d` share it, so a
# new property automatically participates in those operations.
#
# [Import interfaces](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDImport_py.html) use the same mechanism. Every column of an `.ang` or
# `.ctf` file that MTEX does not recognise as position, phase, or orientation becomes a
# property.
