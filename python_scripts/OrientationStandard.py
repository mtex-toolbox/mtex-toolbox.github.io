# # Standard Orientations
#
# Rolling, drawing and recrystallisation produce the same few orientations again and
# again. These ideal orientations have names such as Cube, Goss, Brass and Copper. Naming
# the dominant components describes a texture in one sentence. MTEX provides them so that
# measured orientations can be compared with the conventional ideals.
#
# This page assumes the orientation defined in
# [Defining Orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationDefinition_py.html). It also uses the plane and
# direction notation from [Miller Indices](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalDirections_py.html).
# [Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationSymmetry_py.html) explains why one physical component has several
# equivalent coordinate descriptions.

# ## Predefined Components and Their Frame
#
# The complete set of predefined orientation constructors is
#
# * Cube, CubeND22, CubeND45, CubeRD
# * Goss, invGoss
# * Copper, Copper2
# * SR, SR2, SR3, SR4
# * Brass, Brass2
# * PLage, PLage2, QLage, QLage2, QLage3, QLage4
#
# These names are conventions for cubic rolling and recrystallisation textures. Their
# Euler angles require the same Bunge convention and frames. See
# [MTEX vs. Bunge Convention](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MTEXvsBungeConvention_py.html). The numbered constructors
# retain variants that may be distinct under weak specimen symmetry. With orthorhombic
# specimen symmetry, several are equivalent.
#
# A *reference frame* is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. Here the
# specimen frame is the rolling frame. Specimen X is the rolling direction (RD), and Y is
# the transverse direction (TD). Specimen Z is the normal direction (ND). The plotting
# convention below draws RD north and TD west. Consequently, ND points out of the page.

# ## A Representative Selection

# The following subset contains common ideal components and several rotated Cube
# components.

# ## Plane and Direction Notation
#
# Each legend entry below is generated in the conventional form $(hkl)[uvw]$. The plane
# $(hkl)$ faces the sheet normal, and the direction $[uvw]$ points along the rolling
# direction. Equivalently, the orientation maps the plane normal to ND and the lattice
# direction to RD. [orientation.byMiller](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.byMiller.html) uses this argument
# order. [round2Miller](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.round2Miller.html) reads those two indices back off an
# orientation.

# ## Matching a Measured Orientation
#
# A component match is an angular comparison, not a comparison of three Euler-angle
# columns. As a reproducible stand-in for a measurement, make an orientation five degrees
# from the Copper entry. Then compare it with every component.

# %%
phi1, Phi, phi2 = Euler(components[6])
measured = orientation.byEuler(phi1 + 5 * degree, Phi, phi2, cs, ss)

# %%
componentDistance = angle(measured, components) / degree
bestId = int(np.argmin(componentDistance))

# %%
bestMatch = componentNames[bestId]
bestMatch

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
bestDifference = componentDistance[bestId]
bestDifference

# %% [markdown]
# The closest entry is Copper at $5^\circ$. [angle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.angle.html) uses the
# attached crystal and specimen symmetries. It therefore compares physical components
# rather than arbitrary stored representatives. A real analysis must also state the
# angular tolerance used to call an orientation part of a component.

# ## Three-Dimensional Euler Angle Space
#
# The first view places every component at its three Bunge Euler angles.

# Notice Cube at the zero-angle corner. CubeND22 and CubeND45 move along the $\varphi_1$
# edge, whereas CubeRD moves along the $\Phi$ edge. This plot is a coordinate chart.
# Proximity near a chart boundary need not mean a small physical orientation difference.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Two-Dimensional phi2 Sections
#
# The classical paper view uses sections of fixed $\varphi_2$. This is how rolling
# components are usually recognized in an ODF. See
# [Euler Angle Sections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EulerAngleSections_py.html).

# Notice that one colour can occur at several coordinate positions. These are
# symmetry-equivalent representatives of one component. They are not additional physical
# components.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Three-Dimensional Axis-Angle Space
#
# Axis-angle space places the same components inside the fundamental region of the
# cubic-orthorhombic symmetry pair. See
# [Fundamental Region](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFundamentalRegion_py.html).

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# Cube is the identity orientation at zero rotation. Every other marker is one
# representative chosen from its symmetry class. All nine components therefore fit into
# the single fundamental region.

# ## Pole Figures
#
# A pole figure shows where each component puts selected families of lattice planes. This
# is the view against which a measured pole figure is compared.

# %%
h = Miller([[1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [3, 1, 1]], cs)

legend(location='northeast', numColumns=2)

# %% [markdown]
# For Goss, the $\{110\}$ family has a pole in the centre because its $(011)$ plane faces
# ND. Cube puts $\{100\}$ poles in the centre and on the RD and TD axes of the rim.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inverse Pole Figures
#
# Inverse pole figures ask the opposite question: which crystal direction lies along
# specimen X, Y or Z? In this rolling frame those directions are RD, TD and ND.

# %%
r = cat(vector3d.X, vector3d.Y, vector3d.Z)

# %%
for i in range(len(components)):
  plotIPF(components[i], r, markerSize=(12 - i - 1) ** 1.5, markerFaceColor=ind2color(i + 1), displayName=legendNames[i])
  hold(True)
hold(False)
legend(location='northeast', numColumns=2)

# %% [markdown]
# Several components put the same crystal direction along one specimen axis but differ by
# rotation about it. Their markers coincide in that panel, so the decreasing marker sizes
# keep all components visible. An inverse pole figure loses the rotation about the plotted
# direction. Therefore, it cannot identify a full orientation by itself.

# ## From a Component to a Model Texture
#
# A named component is a single ideal orientation. A real texture has a spread around that
# ideal. Giving the component a halfwidth turns it into a model ODF. This is the quantity
# fitted against measured data; see [Modeling ODFs](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFModeling_py.html).

# %% [markdown]
# The isolated Cube markers have become density peaks at the same pole positions. At
# $7.5^\circ$, the radial kernel falls to half its maximum. This halfwidth is a radius,
# not a $15^\circ$ uniform band.

# ## The Model in Inverse Pole Figures
#
# The same spread appears around the Cube directions in the inverse pole figures.

# %% [markdown]
# Notice that the peak centres agree with the Cube markers in the earlier inverse pole
# figures. Only the ideal point has changed into a continuous neighbourhood.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Model in phi2 Sections
#
# Finally, plot the model in $\varphi_2$ sections and overlay all nine ideal components to
# identify the centre used to build it.

# %%

# The density maximum sits on Cube. The other component markers remain isolated reference
# points and do not contribute to this model ODF.
