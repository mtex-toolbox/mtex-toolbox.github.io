# # Misorientations at grain boundaries
#
# A grain-boundary misorientation is the rotation from the crystal on one side of a
# boundary to the crystal on the other. It has an angle and an axis, but those two
# quantities answer different questions.
#
# The angle is one number and can be drawn along the boundary directly. The axis is a
# direction, so its reference frame decides what it means. A crystal-frame axis can be
# compared with lattice directions, whereas a specimen-frame axis can be compared with
# directions in the map.
#
# This page assumes that the map has already been divided into grains. See
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) for that step.
# [Grain Boundary Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryProperties_py.html) introduces the segment properties
# used below. [Misorientation Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html) develops the symmetry of
# a misorientation.

ebsd = mtexdata('forsterite')

# select a small region so that the boundary-axis arrows remain legible

# ## Reconstruct the boundary network
#
# A 10 degree segmentation angle separates low- from high-angle boundaries. Angles of 10
# or 15 degrees are long-standing conventions, and the useful value depends on the
# material. [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) explains how to choose it.
# Here `minPixel` marks indexed regions of fewer than 10 measurements as `notIndexed`, so
# that specks do not enter the boundary statistics below.

# %%
segAngle = 10 * degree
minPixel = 10
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=segAngle, minPixel=minPixel)

# preserve the segment-to-pixel relation needed below
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 4, simplify=False, refine=False)

# draw the forsterite grains and the complete boundary network
plot(grains['Fo'], faceColor=[0.75, 0.82, 0.90], micronbar='off', figSize='large')
hold(True)
plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=1)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The blue regions are forsterite grains. The white regions belong to other phases, and
# the black lines are all boundary segments in the cropped map. The analysis below uses
# only boundaries between two forsterite grains.
#
# The [smoothBoundary](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.smoothBoundary.html) flags `simplify=False` and `refine=False` are
# important here. Simplification and refinement change which segments lie between specific
# pixel pairs. Their `ebsdId` values can then no longer supply the two orientations used
# below.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The misorientation angle along a boundary
#
# Select one phase pair before comparing misorientations. The command below also gives
# these same-phase misorientations grain exchange symmetry. The two grains have no
# intrinsic order. A rotation and its inverse therefore describe the same boundary. See
# [Grain Exchange Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationGrainExchangeSym_py.html).

# %%
gB = grains.boundary['Fo', 'Fo']

# use a neutral background so that only the boundary carries data colours
newMtexFigure(figSize='large')
plot(grains['Fo'], faceColor=[0.9, 0.9, 0.9], micronbar='off')
hold(True)

# colour each segment by its angle
lineWidth = 6
plot(gB, gB.misorientation.angle() / degree, lineWidth=lineWidth)
hold(False)
mtexColorMap('jet')
mtexColorbar(title='misorientation angle in degrees')

# %% [markdown]
# Long runs have nearly constant colour. Each segment stores the misorientation between
# its two neighbouring EBSD measurements. Small changes along a run reflect orientation
# variation inside the two grains. Larger colour changes occur between different grain
# pairs.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Crystal-frame and specimen-frame axes
#
# A reference frame is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. The crystal
# frame is fixed to the lattice basis, while the specimen frame is fixed to the sample and
# supplies the coordinates of this map.
#
# The axis of `gB.misorientation` is expressed in the crystal frame. This form can be
# compared with crystallographic directions. The stored rotation contains no
# specimen-frame information. Computing a specimen-frame axis requires both orientations
# beside every segment.
#
# `ebsdId` is an $N \times 2$ matrix of measurement IDs. It retrieves the two orientation
# lists without confusing persistent IDs with positions in the current EBSD list.

# %%
ori = ebsd['id', gB.ebsdId].orientations
specimenAxes = axis(ori[:, 0], ori[:, 1], antipodal=True)

# segments are in walk order, so regular indexing thins every chain evenly
sampleId = np.arange(0, len(gB), 3)
hold(True)
quiver(gB[sampleId], specimenAxes[sampleId], lineWidth=2, color='k', autoScaleFactor=0.3)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Each black line is an unoriented axis projected into the section plane. A short line
# marks an axis that points steeply out of the plane. The axes remain nearly parallel
# along most boundaries. This agrees with the nearly constant angle colours beneath them.

# %% [markdown]
# ## When the axis jumps
#
# Along a few boundaries the projected axis changes abruptly, although the orientations
# within the two grains are as uniform as elsewhere. This is not necessarily a feature in
# the specimen. It can be a change in which symmetry-equivalent rotation MTEX selects.
#
# Crystal symmetry gives many rotations that describe the same physical relationship. The
# representative with the smallest angle is the *disorientation*. Near a boundary of the
# misorientation fundamental region, two representatives can have almost the same angle. A
# change of one tenth of a degree can then select a very different axis.
#
# The effect occurs near 120 degrees for forsterite, the largest disorientation angle
# between two orthorhombic crystals. The calculation below compares only consecutive
# segments in the same boundary chain. A chain is a maximal run from one junction to the
# next.

# %%

axisStep = angle(specimenAxes[:-1], specimenAxes[1:], antipodal=True) / degree
segmentAngle = gB.misorientation.angle() / degree

isLowerAngleStep = isAdjacent & ~isHighAngleStep
isLargeStep = axisStep > 30

print(f'Changes above 30 degrees when angle <= 105: {np.count_nonzero(isLargeStep & isLowerAngleStep)} '
      f'of {np.count_nonzero(isLowerAngleStep)}')

# The median step is about half a degree. Above 105 degrees, roughly one adjacent step in
# sixteen turns the axis by more than 30 degrees. At or below 105 degrees, about one in a
# thousand does so. Most abrupt changes in the map therefore lie on the darkest red
# boundary runs. The printed counts quantify that visual association.
#
# The minimum angle remains stable when the minimizing representative changes, but the
# axis can jump. Treat an axis with care near the maximum disorientation angle. Reach for
# this explanation when an axis looks more variable than the orientations on either side
# of the boundary.

# %% [markdown]
# ## A separate trap at small angles
#
# A small-angle axis is unstable for a different reason. Its direction becomes poorly
# constrained as the rotation angle approaches zero. Small orientation errors can then
# greatly change the axis. This limitation matters especially for the low-angle population
# in [Subgrain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SubGrainBoundaries_py.html). It is not the symmetry-branch switch
# measured above.
