# # ODF Estimation from EBSD Data
#
# An EBSD map records one orientation at every indexed measurement. That is a finite list
# of points, and a plot of that list shows where orientations occur but not how many.
# Answering *how much* of the specimen sits near an orientation needs a continuous
# density, and this page estimates one.
#
# The page assumes phase selection from [Select EBSD Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSelect_py.html) and the
# scatter plots of [Plotting Individual Orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDOrientationPlots_py.html). A
# *reference frame* is the coordinate system in which the data are expressed. Check it as
# described in [Reference Frame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) before reading a specimen
# direction from any figure below.
#
# A *plotting convention* states how that frame is laid out on screen. The convention
# below draws specimen Y upward and specimen X to the right. It changes the screen
# layout, not the measured orientations.

# The list holds 16116 orientations. The [IPF colours](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html) form broad
# patches, because neighbouring pixels of one grain repeat nearly the same orientation. A
# *grain* is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels produced by
# segmentation. This map contains a few hundred of them, so its 16116 orientations are
# far fewer than 16116 independent observations. That distinction decides everything
# below.

# ## Start with the orientations themselves

# A pole figure fixes a crystal direction and shows where it points in the specimen.
# Drawing one marker per measurement shows the data and nothing but the data.

# MTEX drew 208 of the 16116 orientations at random, since every one of them contributes
# several symmetrically equivalent poles and the full list would be an opaque blot. The
# option `all=True` overrides that, and `points` sets the sample size.
#
# The markers cover the whole pole figure with faint clumping. Some directions are
# visibly more populated than others, but the plot gives no way to say how much more.
# Overlapping markers hide their own count, so two spots of equal appearance may differ
# by a factor of ten.
#
# Sections through orientation space keep all three orientation coordinates instead of
# projecting one away.

# Now the structure of the sample is plain: the markers sit in tight knots of a dozen or
# more. Each knot is one grain measured many times, not a texture component observed many
# times. The knots can be seen but not counted, exactly as in the pole figure.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Contouring turns markers into values
#
# Adding the option `contourf` replaces the markers by filled contours with a colour bar,
# so the plot finally carries numbers.

# %%

mtexColorbar(title='mrd')

# %% [markdown]
# The unit is *multiples of a random distribution* (mrd). A uniform texture is 1 mrd
# everywhere, so 4 mrd means four times as many poles as a uniform specimen would put
# there. It is not a percentage of the specimen.
#
# The colour bars top out between 3.7 and 4.7 mrd, spread over dozens of separate small
# spots rather than a few texture components.
#
# Those values are not measured but estimated. MTEX places a small bell-shaped function,
# a *kernel*, on every plotted pole and adds the copies up. The width of that kernel is
# its *halfwidth*, the angular distance at which it falls to half its peak value. Left
# unspecified, the contoured pole figure uses 5 degrees. Ask for 15 degrees instead.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# Nothing about the specimen changed between the two figures, and nothing about the
# measurements did either. The dozens of 4 mrd spots have become a gentle undulation
# reaching 1.5 mrd, because one hidden parameter was given a different value. A number
# read off the first figure is therefore a statement about the halfwidth as much as about
# the copper.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Estimate the density explicitly
#
# [calcDensity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/rotation.calcDensity.html) performs the same construction in orientation
# space and returns the result as an object. An *orientation distribution function* (ODF)
# is a density over the orientations of one phase, normalized so that a uniform texture
# is 1 mrd.

# The maxima sit where the knots of the scatter plot were, and the highest reaches 3.7
# mrd. Unlike the contoured pole figure, this estimate is a function that can be
# evaluated, integrated, and compared.
#
# The contoured pole figure was the same estimate seen through one projection. Contouring
# poles with a given halfwidth reproduces the pole figure of the ODF estimated with that
# halfwidth exactly, because projecting the orientation-space kernel onto the sphere
# gives the kernel used there. What `calcDensity` adds is that the choice is visible and
# the result is kept.

# %% [markdown]

# Estimate the same map with a sharper and a smoother kernel and collect the peak
# densities.

# Reconstruct the grains and plot the sharpest estimate with one marker per grain mean

# The whole function now lies between 0.7 and 1.5 mrd, and neighbouring maxima of the
# previous figures have merged into single broad hills. A genuine sharp component would
# be flattened the same way, so this estimate cannot distinguish a weak texture from a
# smeared strong one.
#
# Between those extremes there is no value that is right in general. A halfwidth that is
# too small reproduces the individual grains, one that is too large erases the features
# worth reporting, and which of the two errors matters depends on how representative the
# map is for the whole specimen. A map holding a few hundred grains cannot support a
# sharp ODF, however many pixels it has.

# ## Letting the data choose the halfwidth
#
# [calcKernel](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.calcKernel.html) with `method='KLCV'`, MATLAB's default, selects a
# halfwidth by cross-validation. It
# leaves one orientation out, estimates a density from the rest, and scores how well that
# estimate predicts the omitted one. The halfwidth with the best score over the whole
# sample wins. No model of the texture is needed, only the sample.
#
# The orientations of a map carry the mark `notIID`, since neighbouring pixels are not
# independent draws, and `calcKernel` refuses them. To see what cross-validation makes of
# the pixels anyway, clear the mark on a copy.

# %% [markdown]
# The pixel list returns 2.7 degrees, the regime that reproduces the grains. The reason is
# an assumption, not a bug: cross-validation treats the observations as independent
# draws. Neighbouring pixels of one grain are near copies of each other, so an omitted
# pixel is predicted almost perfectly by the pixels beside it, and the score keeps
# improving as the kernel narrows.
#
# Give the selection one orientation per grain instead. Grain means are not perfectly
# independent either, but they no longer contain the same crystal measured hundreds of

# Cross-validation asks for 4.7 degrees while the two rules ask for about 15, and that
# spread is the useful result. The selected 4.7 degrees is barely above the 4 degrees of
# the spiky figure, so even grain means put the automatic choice in the regime where
# single grains are visible.
#
# The methods answer different questions. Cross-validation asks which halfwidth describes
# *this sample* best, which is the right question only when the sample is the specimen.
# The two rules read only the number of orientations and the symmetry, and a few hundred
# orientations do not buy a sharp estimate.
# [Optimal Kernel Selection](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OptimalKernel_py.html) compares the three methods against a
# known model ODF, where the best halfwidth can be measured rather than argued.
#
# ### Selecting from the pixels and their grains
#
# Two further methods of `calcKernel` estimate the error of the density itself, from the
# harmonic coefficients of the sample. `'UCV'` aims at the halfwidth of least integrated
# squared error, `'conservative'` at one that is at least as wide. Both accept the map once
# its grains are computed: the pixels are then compared only across groups of grains that
# share no grain, so the near copies inside a grain drop out without discarding a pixel.
# `calcGrains` above left the grain ids on `ebsd`.

# %% [markdown]
# UCV asks for 9.7 degrees and the conservative rule for 27, and again the spread is the
# result. The grains are few and of very different sizes: weighted by their area, the map
# carries as much information as about a hundred equally sized grains. UCV alone would
# follow the sample down to the narrowest kernel its harmonic bandwidth resolves; its noise
# floor stops it where the sampling noise of a hundred grains would raise bumps above a
# fifth of the maximum. The conservative rule finds the texture's harmonic energies only
# loosely bounded and stays wide. Close to MATLAB's 10 degrees, then, but for a reason
# that can be stated.

# %% [markdown]
# ## What one observation stands for
#
# The halfwidth settles how far each observation spreads. Which observations enter the
# sum is a separate question with three common answers. All estimates so far used one
# observation per pixel; the other two put one observation per grain, with and without
# an area weight.

# %% [markdown]
# On a regular scan, one pixel per measurement weights each orientation by the area it
# covers. Grain means with equal weights describe the population of segmented grains,
# where a five-pixel grain counts as much as a several-hundred-pixel one; its peak is
# the weakest of the three. Weighting the grain means by grain area restores area
# weighting and comes back close to the pixel estimate:
# [calcError](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcError.html) measures about 0.02 against it, where equal grain
# weights measure 0.16.
#
# The two grain-based estimates share a cost that the table does not show. Each grain
# enters as a single orientation, so the orientation spread inside it is discarded
# entirely.

# In this recrystallized copper the mean spread within a grain is about a degree and at
# most seven degrees, well below any halfwidth considered here, so little is lost. In
# deformed material the spread inside one grain reaches tens of degrees and carries much
# of the texture. There a grain-mean ODF is not a smoothed version of the pixel ODF but a
# different quantity, and a map with few grains rests the whole estimate on very few
# numbers.
#
# A practical division of labour follows from the two sections: select the halfwidth
# from grain means, which are approximately independent, or from the pixels together with
# their grain ids, and estimate the density from the pixels, which carry the area and the
# intragranular spread.
#
# Whatever the choice, state it. An area fraction measured in a section is not
# automatically a bulk volume fraction; that step needs sampling and stereological
# assumptions of its own.
#
# Finally, do not estimate a density from a densified or interpolated copy of a map.
# Repeated cells are not new measurements and would take extra statistical weight.

# ## The definition
#
# Let $\psi : \mathrm{SO}(3) \to \mathbf{R}$ be a radially symmetric, unimodal kernel.
# Let the orientations $o_1,o_2,\ldots,o_M$ carry non-negative weights
# $w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_M$. The weighted kernel density estimator is
#
# $$f(o) = \frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{M} w_j} \sum_{i=1}^{M} w_i \psi(o o_i^{-1}).$$
#
# Each observation contributes one copy of $\psi$ centred on itself, and its weight sets
# how much mass that copy carries. The halfwidth of $\psi$ is the only smoothing
# parameter.
#
# The formula suppresses symmetry notation for readability. MTEX accounts for the
# symmetry-equivalent representatives carried by each orientation. Different phases
# generally carry different crystal symmetries, which is why an EBSD-derived ODF is
# estimated from one selected phase at a time.
# [Kernel Functions on SO(3)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Kernels_py.html) compares the available kernel families,
# and [Density Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html) develops the same estimator for real
# numbers and for directions.
