#
# [Grain Boundary Smoothing](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainSmoothing_py.html) introduces
# [`smoothBoundary`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.smoothBoundary.html). This page explains its three stages,
# the tolerances they use, and the four filters available for the last stage.
#
# The page assumes that grains have already been reconstructed as in
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html). A grain boundary is one segment between
# neighbouring EBSD measurements that belong to different grains. A *chain* is a maximal
# run of those segments from one junction to the next.
# [Grain Boundary Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryProperties_py.html) introduces this representation in
# detail.

# The yellow-green staircase is the measured boundary in the area used throughout the page.
# Its steps follow the square measurement grid rather than the physical boundary direction.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Step 1: remove the grid staircase
#
# For an ideal straight boundary, the staircase is never farther than `d/sqrt(2)` from the
# line it approximates. The worst case is a boundary at 45 degree, whose corners lie
# exactly that far from the diagonal. [`simplifyBoundary`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.simplifyBoundary.html)
# therefore uses this as its default tolerance. It drops a vertex when removing it moves
# the boundary by less than the tolerance.
#
# This argument separates the ideal grid staircase from features at larger scales. It
# cannot distinguish a real feature at the grid scale from a sampling artefact.

# %%
grainsSimple = simplifyBoundary(grains, d / np.sqrt(2))

plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=5, lineColor='YellowGreen', micronbar='off', region=[313, 353, 140, 156])
hold(True)
plot(grainsSimple.boundary, lineWidth=2, lineColor='Fuchsia')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The magenta boundary has lost the staircase and is much shorter. It also has far fewer
# vertices because essentially only the corners have survived.

# %%
print(f'simplifying at a tolerance of {d / np.sqrt(2):.2f} {grains.scanUnit} takes the boundary '
      f'from {len(grains.boundary)} segments to {len(grainsSimple.boundary)}')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Step 2: restore evenly spaced samples
#
# Smoothing the simplified result directly would be a mistake. A curved chain is now
# represented by a few long chords, and a Laplacian cuts the corners from the polygon they
# form. A circle with a radius of 15 pixels loses 14% of its area over 25 iterations that
# way, compared with 0.4% when this resampling step is included.
#
# [`refineBoundary`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.refineBoundary.html) resamples each chain at equal arc length.
# It changes only the sampling, not the polygonal shape. The smoothing stage then receives
# evenly spaced degrees of freedom that are no longer tied to the measurement grid.

# %%
grainsRefined = refineBoundary(grainsSimple, d)

print(f'resampling at {d:.2f} {grains.scanUnit} puts them back: {len(grainsSimple.boundary)} segments '
      f'to {len(grainsRefined.boundary)}')

# %% [markdown]
# ## Step 3: smooth the resampled boundary
#
# Only now does the filter move the boundary. A *junction* is a vertex where the number of
# meeting segments is not two. Junctions remain fixed by default.

# %%
grainsSmooth = smoothBoundary(grainsRefined, 5, simplify=False, refine=False)

plot(grains.boundary, lineWidth=5, lineColor='YellowGreen', micronbar='off', region=[313, 353, 140, 156])
hold(True)
plot(grainsSmooth.boundary, lineWidth=2, lineColor='Fuchsia')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The magenta trace now follows the larger turns of the measured boundary without
# reproducing its pixel-scale steps.
#
# These three stages are exactly what `smoothBoundary(grains, 5)` performs. Both tolerances
# come from the median segment length measured *before* the first stage. After
# simplification, that median describes the straightened runs rather than the pixel
# spacing. The tolerances may also be set explicitly.

# %%
grainsCoarse = smoothBoundary(grains, 5, simplify=d / np.sqrt(2), refine=2 * d)

print(f'resampling at {2 * d:.2f} {grains.scanUnit} instead leaves {len(grainsCoarse.boundary)} segments')

# %% [markdown]
# ## What preprocessing changes
#
# Simplification and resampling change the number of boundary segments. A resampled
# segment no longer lies between one specific pair of EBSD measurements, so its row of
# `gB.ebsdId` no longer identifies the pixels on its two sides. Use `simplify=False` and
# `refine=False` when an analysis needs that per-segment association.
#
# Smoothing also changes lengths, areas, directions, and curvatures. It is a measurement
# choice, not merely a plotting choice. Record the filter and its settings when comparing
# maps or reporting shape statistics.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Choose the filter
#
# A [`boundaryFilter`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/boundaryFilter.html) controls the third stage.
# [`laplaceFilter`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/laplaceFilter.html) and [`taubinFilter`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/taubinFilter.html) apply a
# local averaging step a fixed number of times. Their effect therefore depends on how
# densely the boundary is sampled. [`curvatureFilter`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/curvatureFilter.html) and
# [`huberFilter`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/huberFilter.html) instead specify a smoothing length in map units, which
# does not change when the same sample is measured on a finer grid. That length makes the
# setting comparable between scans only when their spatial units and preprocessing are also
# comparable.
#
# Do not expect to distinguish sensible settings by eye on this map. All four results lie
# within a line width of one another, but their sub-pixel differences appear in boundary
# statistics. The following examples therefore compare grain areas.
#
# The reference has passed through simplification and resampling but not smoothing. In
# other words, zero below means zero filter iterations, not the original pixel boundary.
# Grains with reference areas no greater than `10*d^2` are excluded so that a few-pixel
# grain does not dominate the percentages.

# %%

A0 = ref.area
big = A0 > 10 * d**2
A0 = A0[big]

print(f'area comparison uses {np.count_nonzero(big)} of {len(ref)} grains')

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Laplace filter
#
# [`laplaceFilter`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/laplaceFilter.html) is the default. It replaces each movable vertex by a
# weighted local mean, `iter` times. It is fast and useful for plots, directions, and
# lengths, but repeated averaging pulls a convex grain inward. Nothing bounds that
# shrinkage.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Taubin filter
#
# [`taubinFilter`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/taubinFilter.html) follows every smoothing pass with a slightly larger
# unshrinking pass. This approximately gives the area back instead of letting the mean area
# drift downwards. Areas still change, so the method is shrinkage resistant rather than
# exactly area preserving.

# ## The curvature filter
#
# [`curvatureFilter`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/curvatureFilter.html) has no iteration count. `smoothingLength` is the
# wavelength damped to half amplitude, in the units of the map. Detail finer than that
# length is suppressed more strongly, and coarser detail survives. This gives the parameter
# a physical meaning that an iteration count does not have.

# %%

F.smoothingLength = 8 * d

print(f'  {100 * np.mean((aC - A0) / A0):+6.2f}% on average, {100 * np.min((aC - A0) / A0):+6.1f}% for the worst grain')

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Huber filter
#
# [`huberFilter`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/huberFilter.html) uses the same smoothing length but protects sharp
# corners. Gentle undulations are smoothed like `curvatureFilter`, while a genuinely
# faceted boundary keeps its facets. This protection can also preserve corners left by the
# pixel grid on a boundary that is really straight or smooth. Reach for this filter when
# the material is faceted, not by default.
#
# `threshold` is the turning angle at one vertex of the result, not the total angle of a
# corner. Smoothing first spreads a corner over roughly `smoothingLength/h` vertices, where
# `h` is their spacing. The Huber step then sharpens it again. For a rasterized hexagon with
# `smoothingLength = 8*h`, measured 60 degree corners return as follows.
#
# | threshold (degree) | 30 | 15 | 8 | 4 | 2 |
# |---|---|---|---|---|---|
# | recovered corner (degree) | 22 | 28 | 49 | 68 | 80 |
#
# A threshold of 15 degree is appropriate for the
# [`halfQuadraticFilter`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDDenoising_py.html) on orientations, but it would never activate
# corner protection here. The default boundary threshold is 5 degree.

# %%
G = huberFilter()
G.smoothingLength = 8 * d

aH = smoothBoundary(grains, G).area[big]

print('grain area, huberFilter at the same smoothing length')
print(f'  {100 * np.mean((aH - A0) / A0):+6.2f}% on average, {100 * np.min((aH - A0) / A0):+6.1f}% for the worst grain')

# %% [markdown]
# A synthetic Voronoi map provides a case whose boundaries are exactly straight. On that
# map, `huberFilter` doubles the scatter of the boundary directions compared with
# `curvatureFilter` because it protects raster corners as if they were facets. This is the
# cost of preserving real corners.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Moving junctions
#
# By default, all junctions remain fixed. The grains that touch and the junction positions
# therefore stay unchanged. Despite its name, `moveTriplePoints` releases every non-outer
# junction, not only triple points. The outer map boundary remains fixed unless
# `moveOuterBoundary` is also passed.

# ## The maths behind the filters
#
# The normalized boundary Laplacian `L` measures how far a vertex lies from the mean of its
# neighbours. The Laplace filter applies a low-pass step with gain $1-\lambda k$. Its
# adjacency includes the vertex itself with the weight of its degree. A vertex with two
# neighbours therefore uses `(2*V + Vl + Vr)/4`. The documented default `lambda = 0.5`
# consequently acts at a rate of 0.25. The `'gauss'`, `'exp'`, and `'umbrella'` kernels
# reweight this adjacency by neighbour distance.
#
# The Taubin filter follows that step with a negative step `mu`. The gain of a pair is
# $(1-\lambda k)(1-\mu k)$, which is approximately one at low frequencies when `mu` is
# chosen slightly larger in magnitude than `lambda`. High-frequency boundary steps are
# damped while broad shape is restored.
#
# The curvature filter instead finds the vertices $\mathbf{V}$ that minimize
#
# $$\|\mathbf{V}-\mathbf{V}_0\|^2 + \alpha\|L\mathbf{V}\|^2.$$
#
# The minimizer comes from one sparse linear system. Fixed junctions are eliminated from
# that system rather than penalized, so they stay exactly in place. On vertices sampled at
# spacing $h$, the filter gain is $1/(1+4\alpha\sin^4(\omega/2))$. The value of
# `smoothingLength` is the wavelength damped to half amplitude. Using the exact inverse
# rather than a small-angle approximation matters at short wavelengths: the approximation
# is already 20% wrong at four times the spacing. The implemented cutoff is within 0.05%
# of the requested value from three to 400 times the spacing.
#
# The Huber filter replaces the squared curvature penalty with a Huber function. It is
# quadratic below `threshold` and linear above it. A least-squares penalty spreads a large
# turn over many vertices and rounds a corner. A linear, $\ell^1$-like penalty
# concentrates the turn into fewer vertices and preserves the corner. MTEX solves this
# problem by iteratively reweighted least squares until it converges. The `maxIter`
# property is a safety limit, not a smoothing control.
