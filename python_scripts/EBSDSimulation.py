# # EBSD Simulation
#
# A map-processing method is easiest to test on a map whose answer is known in advance.
# The [simulateEBSD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/simulateEBSD.simulateEBSD.html) class constructs such a map one
# feature at a time. It can add orientation noise, a low-angle boundary, or an orientation
# gradient to a uniform field.
#
# This makes it useful for checking [denoising](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDDenoising_py.html) and [KAM](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDKAM_py.html).
# It also supplies known input for [GND](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GND_py.html) and [WBV](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/WBV_py.html) calculations.
# Synthetic and experimental examples appear in
# [Hielscher et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576719009075).
#
# First read about [orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationDefinition_py.html) and
# [misorientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html). The page also assumes familiarity with
# [grain reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html).
#
# ## What is being simulated
#
# `simulateEBSD` constructs an `EBSD` variable containing positions, a phase, and
# orientations. It does not generate diffraction patterns or model the detector, pattern
# indexing, spatial distortion, or failed measurements. A program such as
# [EMsoft](https://github.com/EMsoft-org/EMsoft) is needed for physics-based EBSD pattern
# simulation.
#
# The class is designed for a single-grain orientation field. Use the
# [Neper interface](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/NeperInterface_py.html) when polycrystal topology matters.
#
# ## The object and its defaults
#
# The object holds the map settings and the current simulated map. Its defaults specify
# coordinate limits of 100 by 100 and a unit step size. They do not create a map or add
# noise until the corresponding methods are called.

# ## A uniform orientation field
#
# Set the coordinate limit, crystal symmetry, and reference orientation. The method
# `makeMap` then creates the `EBSD` variable in `eS.EBSDsim`.

# The summary reports 20,000 measurements of one indexed phase. The map has one colour
# because every measurement carries `ori0` exactly. This is the known reference field to
# which the following features are added.
#
# ## Adding orientation noise
#
# Noise is a random rotation about a random axis in the specimen frame. `noiseFun` selects
# a uniform or lognormal distribution of rotation angles. For `'logn'`, the sampled angles
# are rescaled so that the largest equals `noiseMax`; `noiseMax` is not a parameter of a
# lognormal distribution. The noise is drawn from `eS.rng`, a NumPy generator, and from a
# fresh one when it is `None`; a seeded generator makes the page reproducible.

      f'{np.quantile(noiseAngle, 0.9):.2f} degree; maximum {noiseAngle.max():.2f} degree')

# %% [markdown]
# The deviation map shows many small rotations and a sparse long tail. Its printed maximum
# reaches the requested 2°. The median and 90th percentile describe the reproducible sample
# used here. This is orientation-level noise, not noise in simulated diffraction patterns.
#
# ## A known low-angle boundary
#
# A step feature is specified by a misorientation axis in the specimen frame and a total
# misorientation angle. `addFeature('singleStep')` rotates one stepped domain relative to the
# other.

# %%
eS.axS = yvector
eS.moriAngle = 3 * degree
eS.addFeature('singleStep')

# %% [markdown]
# Feature methods modify the orientations already in `eS.EBSDsim`. They therefore
# accumulate: this 3° step is added to the noisy map rather than to a fresh uniform map.
#
# The boundary segments name their pixels by id, `ebsdId`, while `domainID` is a mask over
# the gridded map, so the mask is read through the ids of the map.

# The left map contains one domain scattered around `ori0` and another scattered around the
# 3° offset. The right map uses 10° as the grain-boundary threshold and 1° as the lower,
# subgrain threshold. The connected field is one grain. Its known step is stored in
# `innerBoundary`.
#
# The narrow colour range makes variation along the boundary visible. The printed mean
# stays close to the imposed 3°. Its range records the noise that was added before the
# step. The count is the number of individual grain boundary segments along the stepped
# feature. Other short entries in `innerBoundary` can be caused by neighbouring noise
# rotations that differ by more than 1°. The `domainID` mask isolates the segments that
# cross the feature whose true location is known.
#
# Synthetic noisy maps are particularly useful when the imposed boundary is close to the
# angular noise. See [Germain et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matchar.2014.10.007).
#
# ## Starting over with an orientation gradient
#
# `makeMap` discards the accumulated features and restores a uniform field. For a
# gradient, `gradDir` gives the direction of increase in the specimen frame. Here
# `moriAngle` is the angle increment per spatial grid step, not the total angle used by
# the step feature.

# %%

eS.axS = yvector
eS.gradDir = xvector
eS.moriAngle = 0.03 * degree
eS.addFeature('simpleGradient')

gradientAngle = angle(eS.ori0, eS.EBSDsim.orientations) / degree
print(f'Gradient deviation: {gradientAngle.min():.2f} to {gradientAngle.max():.2f} degree')

plot(eS.EBSDsim, gradientAngle)
mtexColorbar(title='deviation from ori0 in degree')

# %% [markdown]
# The colour changes smoothly from left to right because `gradDir` is `xvector`. With the
# default unit step, each column adds 0.03° about `yvector`. The first column is already one
# increment from `ori0` because the default map coordinates start at one.
#
# Further gradients can be superposed by changing `axS`, `gradDir`, or `moriAngle` and
# calling `addFeature('simpleGradient')` again. In contrast, `addFeature('circularSubgrain')`
# applies `moriAngle` as one total rotation. It changes the orientations inside a circular
# domain. Assign an existing map to `eS.EBSDsim` to start from measured or separately
# generated data.
