# # Convolution of Rotational and Spherical Functions
#
# Convolution combines two functions by averaging their overlap while one argument is
# rotated. It is used to smooth a function, transfer an orientation distribution to
# directions, and construct rotation-dependent similarities. A cross-correlation uses the
# same machinery but may also require inversion or complex conjugation, depending on its
# convention.
#
# Four combinations occur in MTEX:
#
# | first input | second input | result | compatibility |
# |---|---|---|---|
# | `SO3Fun` | `SO3Fun` | `SO3Fun` | first right = second left |
# | `S2Fun` | `S2Fun` | `SO3Fun` | spherical frames must agree |
# | `SO3Fun` | `S2Fun` | `S2Fun` | rotational left = spherical symmetry |
# | `SO3Fun` or `S2Fun` | matching radial kernel | same domain as function |
#
# The left and right sides are defined on
# [Symmetry of Orientation-Dependent Functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunSymmetricFunctions_py.html). Matching
# means the same point group in the same reference frame, not merely point groups with the
# same printed name.

# Bright directions receive large contributions from many orientations where both input

# The Monte Carlo orientations cover the full rotation group. `stripSym` removes the quartz
# point group while retaining its crystal frame. Using a symmetry-reduced fundamental region

# ## Use the inverse-action variant
#
# A second convention acts on the spherical argument with the inverse rotation. It applies

# calling `conv`.

# ## The maths behind convolution
#
# MTEX uses normalized Haar measure. If $\mathrm{d}q$ denotes the usual unnormalized measure
# with volume $8\pi^2$, convolution of compatible rotational functions is
#
# $$ (f*g)(R)=\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int_{\mathrm{SO}(3)}
# f(q)g(q^{-1}R)\,\mathrm{d}q. $$
#
# If $f$ has left symmetry $S_L$ and right symmetry $S_x$, while $g$ has left symmetry $S_x$
# and right symmetry $S_R$, the result has left symmetry $S_L$ and right symmetry $S_R$.
# Swapping the order gives the right-sided form
#
# $$ (g*f)(R)=\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int_{\mathrm{SO}(3)}
# f(q)g(Rq^{-1})\,\mathrm{d}q. $$
#
# The sphere has volume $4\pi$. For two spherical functions, MTEX uses
#
# $$ (f*g)(R)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\mathbb S^2}
# f(R^{-1}\xi)g(\xi)\,\mathrm{d}\xi. $$
#
# The two rotational--spherical actions are
#
# $$ (f*h)(\xi)=\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int_{\mathrm{SO}(3)}
# f(q)h(q\xi)\,\mathrm{d}q $$
#
# and, with `'inv'`,
#
# $$ (f*h)(\xi)=\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int_{\mathrm{SO}(3)}
# f(q)h(q^{-1}\xi)\,\mathrm{d}q. $$
#
# Finally, a zonal spherical kernel $\psi$ satisfies
#
# $$ (f*\psi)(v)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\mathbb S^2}
# f(\xi)\psi(\xi\mathbin{\cdot}v)\,\mathrm{d}\xi. $$
#
# Regarding the kernel as the spherical function $\psi(\xi\mathbin{\cdot}e_3)$ instead gives
# an `SO3Fun`. Its value at $R$ equals the spherical result at $v=R^{-1}e_3$. For an
# `SO3Kernel`, $\omega(q^{-1}R)=\omega(Rq^{-1})$ explains the special commutativity.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB's `S2FunHarmonicSym(sF, cs)` is `S2FunHarmonic(sF, cs)` here, a function in the
# frame of its symmetry; the random draws are NumPy's, so the checks agree with MATLAB's in
# kind, not in their digits. MATLAB's `smoothSource = rotF; smoothSource.bandwidth = …`
# copies the function; the page builds the truncated copy with the constructor, since the
# Python assignment would change `rotF` itself.
