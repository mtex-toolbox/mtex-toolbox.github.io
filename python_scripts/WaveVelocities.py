# # Wave Velocities
#
# An elastic disturbance travels through a crystal as three waves.
# For each propagation direction there is one fast, roughly compressional
# P-wave and two slower S-waves.
# Each wave has a speed and a polarisation direction.
#
# Anisotropy makes all six quantities depend on propagation direction.
# This page computes them from a stiffness tensor, visualises shear-wave
# splitting, and compares phase velocity with energy velocity.

# ## The maths behind the wave speeds
#
# Consider a plane wave with propagation direction $n$, phase velocity $v$,
# and polarisation $p$.
# Its displacement field has the form
#
# $$u(x,t)=p\,f(n\cdot x-vt).$$
#
# Insert this trial wave into the equation of motion
# $\rho\,\partial_t^2u_i=\partial_j\sigma_{ij}$.
# Use Hooke's law $\sigma_{ij}=C_{ijkl}\varepsilon_{kl}$ from
# [Anisotropic Elasticity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/AnisotropicTheory_py.html).
# The result is the Christoffel equation
#
# $$C_{ijkl}n_jn_l\,p_k=\rho v^2p_i.$$
#
# The rank-two tensor $T_{ik}(n)=C_{ijkl}n_jn_l$ is the Christoffel tensor.
# [ChristoffelTensor](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/stiffnessTensor.ChristoffelTensor.html) computes it
# for a chosen propagation direction.

# The symmetry $C_{ijkl}=C_{klij}$ makes $T$ symmetric.
# Its three eigenvalues are therefore real and its eigenvectors are mutually
# perpendicular.
# Positive-definite stiffness also makes all three eigenvalues positive.
# They correspond to three real wave speeds.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB's `addOption(C, 'density', rho)` is the assignment `C.density = rho`; the loader
# already reads the density 3.355 g/cm$^3$ the olivine file states. `velocity` returns its
# six outputs as one named tuple, so a single output is picked by name, `velocity(C,
# xyz).vp`, where MATLAB takes the first. Without a direction the speeds and polarisations
# are functions solving the Christoffel equation wherever they are evaluated, where MATLAB
# interpolates on a triangulated grid of 18338 nodes; so the extremes are exact, 7.65306
# and 9.7739 km/s for MATLAB's 7.65328 and 9.7735, and the P-wave anisotropy is 24.3398
# for MATLAB's 24.3329. The extremes of an antipodal function are axes, so the markers of
# the maximum and the minimum appear at both of their ends on the rim, where MATLAB marks
# one. `eig` returns the eigenvalues first. `S2VectorFieldHarmonic.normal()` is MATLAB's
# static method with its parentheses.
