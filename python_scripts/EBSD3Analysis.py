# # Three-Dimensional EBSD Analysis
#
# Everything measured on a polished surface is a section through something
# three-dimensional, and a section is a biased witness. A section through a grain almost
# never passes through its widest part, so its apparent size is smaller than that grain's
# full extent. An elongated grain can look equiaxed when it is cut across rather than along
# its long direction, and the inclination of a grain boundary away from the section is lost
# altogether.
#
# Three-dimensional data removes these compromises. It can come from serial sectioning,
# from diffraction techniques that probe a volume, or from a simulated microstructure. This
# page walks through the whole analysis on one such data set: import the volume, look at
# it, cut sections, reconstruct the grains, measure them, and smooth their boundaries. Every
# step has a page of its own in this chapter that treats it in depth.

# ## Import a volume
#
# `EBSD3.load` reads a volume from a DREAM.3D file or from the Xnovo GrainMapper3D format
# and detects which of the two it is given. The sample data set is a simulated nine-phase
# volume in the Xnovo format, which `mtexdata` fetches by name.

# The summary reports a 50 x 50 x 50 grid rather than a list: the measurements are held in
# an `EBSD3` object whose entries are addressed as `ebsd[i, j, k]` along $x$, $y$ and $z$.
# Each of the nine phases occupies about a twelfth of the voxels and the remaining fifth is
# not indexed. The voxel is 10 micron on a side and the volume spans half a millimetre in
# each direction.

# ## Display the volume
#
# `plot(ebsd)` draws three slice planes through the middle of the volume; its figure links
# to an interactive page, and `show3d()` opens it in a window. For a figure of chosen
# planes, cut the three central slices with `slice` and draw them into one axes. Each slice
# is an ordinary two-dimensional EBSD map, coloured by phase.

# The specimen is a cylinder standing along $z$: the horizontal section is a disc and the

# through the volume without any layering.

# ## Cut sections
#
# A slice is taken through any plane, given by its normal and one point on it. The
# measurements of a section keep their position in the specimen, and the section is seen
# along the normal of the plane it was cut with, so an oblique cut displays like any other
# map.

# ## Reconstruct the grains
#
# A grain is a connected region of voxels of one phase whose orientations differ by less
# than a threshold. `calcGrains` segments the volume with the same misorientation criteria
# as the planar case and returns a `grain3d` object. Where an `EBSD3` holds one measurement
# per voxel, a `grain3d` holds each grain as a closed polyhedron: its faces carry the
# geometry, its phase and mean orientation describe the material inside. `minPixel`
# dissolves grains of fewer than ten voxels into their neighbours; a grain that small is all
# corners and no surface.

# %%
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=2 * degree, minPixel=10)
print(grains)

# %% [markdown]
# Voxels that are not indexed form regions of their own, which are listed as grains of the
# phase `notIndexed`. The indexed grains are selected the way a phase is selected on a map.

# %%
grains = grains['indexed']

# Plotting the whole collection shows the outer surface of the volume, one colour per
# phase. Every grain behind it is present in the collection.

# %% [markdown]
# Individual grains are addressed by their `id`. The five largest grains of the volume,
# drawn together, show the surface a reconstruction from voxels produces: every face is a
# voxel face, so the surface is a staircase whose normals all point along the axes.

largest = grains[order[:5]]

# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DReconstruction_py.html) explains the criteria, the `minPixel`
# option and how to compare the result with the grain ids a file already carries.
# [Three-Dimensional Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3D_py.html) imports a mesh from DREAM.3D instead of
# reconstructing one.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Measure the grains
#
# A three-dimensional grain has a `volume` and a `surface` area, and neither needs a
# stereological correction. Volumes are in cubic millimetres here, the unit of the
# coordinates.

# %%
print(np.column_stack([largest.volume, largest.surface()]))

# %% [markdown]
# The two combine into a dimensionless measure of compactness, the surface area divided by
# the volume to the power two thirds. A sphere gives the smallest possible value,
# $(36\pi)^{1/3} \approx 4.84$, a cube gives 6, and a grain with a rough or elongated
# surface gives more.

# %% [markdown]
# Every grain lies well above the cube's 6, although the grains are equiaxed and convex.
# The staircase inflates the surface: a voxel surface has the area of the axis-aligned
# faces it is made of, whatever shape it encloses. Sizes are unaffected, since the volume
# of a voxel grain is exact.
#
# [Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DProperties_py.html) covers diameters, principal axes, neighbours and
# the per-face properties of the boundary.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Smooth the boundaries
#
# The staircase is removed in two steps. `reduceBoundary` merges the vertices of each
# voxel-sized cell of a coarser lattice, which already averages the steps and leaves a mesh
# a quarter the size. `smoothBoundary` then moves the vertices with one of the boundary
# filters of the planar case. Triple lines, quadruple points and the outer hull of the
# volume stay where they are, so the network keeps its topology.

grainsS = smoothBoundary(reduceBoundary(grains, 2, quadric=True), taubinFilter(20))

# %% [markdown]
# The same five grains are now bounded by smooth surfaces. The volume of the whole specimen
# is conserved exactly, since its hull is fixed. Between the grains and the unindexed
# regions between them a fraction of a percent moves, and the volume of a single grain
# changes by a few percent.

# ## Where to read on
#
# [Neper Interface](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/NeperInterface_py.html) generates a synthetic polycrystal or imports an
# existing `.tess` file, which gives a microstructure of known construction to test an
# analysis against. [Operations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DOperations_py.html) traces planar sections back to
# their parent grains, triangulates polygonal faces and rotates a collection.
#
# The two-dimensional foundations are developed in [EBSD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDAnalysis.html),
# [Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains.html) and [Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainBoundaries.html).

# ## Technical details
#
# `calcGrains` alters the volume it is given, so MATLAB's `[grains, ebsd] =
# calcGrains(ebsd, ...)` is `grains = calcGrains(ebsd, ...)`; `'quadric'` is the keyword
# `quadric=True`. MATLAB's plain `histogram` is matplotlib's, `DisplayName` its `label`.
