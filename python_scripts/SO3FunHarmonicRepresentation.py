# # Harmonic Representation of Rotational Functions
#
# A rotational function can be stored as a finite list of coefficients instead of as
# values on an orientation grid. This is the harmonic representation used by
# `SO3FunHarmonic`. It is useful for analysing smoothness, filtering by angular scale,
# and turning many operations on functions into algebra on their coefficients.
#
# This page assumes the definition and normalization of an
# [orientation distribution function (ODF)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html) and the common interface
# introduced in [Orientation Dependent Functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunConcept_py.html). An ODF is one
# important rotational function, but the harmonic representation applies to any scalar
# function on the rotation group.

# ## The Series and Its Bandwidth
#
# Fourier series replace a complicated function by a weighted sum of known basis
# functions. On a circle those basis functions are sines and cosines. On the rotation
# group they are Wigner-D functions. Thus a rotational function
# $f\colon \mathrm{SO}(3) \to \mathbb C$ can be written as
#
# $$ f(\mathbf{R}) = \sum_{n=0}^N \sum_{k,l=-n}^n \hat f_n^{k,l}\,\mathrm{D}_n^{k,l}(\mathbf{R}). $$
#
# Here $\hat f_n^{k,l}$ are the Fourier coefficients and $\mathrm{D}_n^{k,l}$ are the
# [Wigner-D functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/WignerFunctions_py.html). The largest retained degree $N$ is the
# *bandwidth*. Increasing the bandwidth permits narrower detail, but it does not recover
# information already absent from the source data. A sharp cutoff removes fine scales
# and therefore smooths the function, although it can also cause ringing near sharp
# features.
#
# Before symmetry is taken into account, degree $n$ contributes $(2n+1)^2$ coefficients.
# A series through bandwidth $N$ therefore has
#
# $$ \sum_{n=0}^N(2n+1)^2 = \frac{(N+1)(2N+1)(2N+3)}{3} $$
#
# coefficients. This cubic growth is why bandwidth affects storage and computation much
# more strongly than its name may suggest.
#
# Several normalizations of Wigner-D functions occur in the literature. MTEX uses an
# orthonormal basis with respect to the normalized measure on $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, so
#
# $$ \|\mathrm{D}_n^{k,l}\|_2 = 1. $$
#
# Crystal and specimen symmetry restrict which coefficient combinations are admissible.
# MTEX applies those restrictions through the symmetries attached to the function. The
# basis convention and its relation to other conventions are detailed under
# [Wigner-D Functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/WignerFunctions_py.html).

# ## Converting an ODF
#
# Start with an ODF reconstructed from the Dubna pole figure data. The zero-range flag
# belongs to that reconstruction; the page on [the Dubna example](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureDubna_py.html)
# explains why it is used.

# %%
pf = mtexdata('dubna')
odf = calcODF(pf, resolution=5 * degree, zeroRange=True, verbose=False)

# %% [markdown]
# Converting any `SO3Fun` to `SO3FunHarmonic` computes a finite harmonic approximation.
# Here the requested bandwidth is 32. The conversion keeps the crystal and specimen
# symmetries of the ODF.

# %%
f = SO3FunHarmonic(odf, bandwidth=32)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Coefficient Storage
#
# The complex Fourier coefficients are stored in `f.fhat` as one vector. The degree-zero
# block is `f.fhat[0]`. The nine entries `f.fhat[1:10]` form the degree-one block, and
# the next 25 entries form the degree-two block. Within a block, rows correspond to
# $k=-n,\ldots,n$ and columns to $l=-n,\ldots,n$. MATLAB stores the columns one after
# another. The degree-two coefficient matrix is therefore

# %%
f.fhat[10:35].reshape(5, 5, order='F')

# %% [markdown]
# Up to its bandwidth, this vector completely characterizes the harmonic function. The
# compact representation also makes many calculations algebraic. For example,
# orientation averages of symmetric second-rank single-crystal properties such as
# thermal expansion or conductivity need only low harmonic degrees. Fourth-rank elastic
# properties additionally involve degree four. The effective property still depends on
# the single-crystal tensor; the ODF coefficients describe the texture part of the
# average.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Constructing a Function from Coefficients
#
# A harmonic function can also be constructed directly from its coefficient vector. In
# the following example $\hat f_0^{0,0}=0.5$ and the degree-one block is
#
# $$ \hat f_1 = \left(\begin{array}{rrr} 1 & 4 & 7 \\ 2 & 5 & 8 \\ 3 & 6 & 9 \end{array}\right). $$

# %%
f2 = SO3FunHarmonic(np.concatenate([[0.5], np.arange(1, 10)]))
f2.isReal

# %% [markdown]
# The printed false value is deliberate. Real entries in `f.fhat` do not by themselves
# define a real-valued rotational function; paired coefficients must satisfy the
# conjugate symmetry imposed by the Wigner-D basis. This distinction matters before
# plotting, because a plot of a complex function can show only one real-valued part.
#
# Identity matrices satisfy the reality relation and give a small example through degree
# two. The vector order is degree first, then $l$, then $k$.

# The summary shows that MTEX inferred bandwidth 2 from the vector length. The negative
# minimum shows why a coefficient vector does not automatically define an ODF. An ODF
# must be real, nonnegative, and normalized to mean one. Truncating the series of a sharp
# positive ODF can likewise create small negative undershoots, just as a truncated
# ordinary Fourier series can ring near a sharp edge.

# The sigma sections show the full rotational function. The colorbar spans negative and
# positive values, which is the visible consequence of choosing coefficients without

# These pole figures are projections of the same coefficient series. A plausible-looking
# projection is not evidence that the function itself is a valid ODF; the reality,
# positivity, and normalization checks still apply in orientation space.

# ## Reading a Spectrum
#
# [plotSpectrum](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.plotSpektra.html) groups the coefficients by degree. At each degree
# it plots the square root of their summed squared magnitudes, not the individual
# coefficients.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# Read the curve from left to right as the amount of progressively finer angular
# structure. Fast decay means that a lower bandwidth may preserve the function well. A
# slow or irregular tail means that high-degree content remains. In a pole-figure
# inversion, that tail can also indicate the ghost effect; see
# [Ghost Correction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFGhostCorrection_py.html).

# ## Harmonic Approximation of a General SO3Fun
#
# Nothing in the harmonic representation requires the function to be an ODF. As an
# example, take the misorientation angle to a fixed orientation. It is nonnegative, but
# it is not normalized to mean one and is therefore not an ODF.

# %%

# [quadrature](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature.html) evaluates the function on a quadrature
# grid and computes its Fourier coefficients. Request the same bandwidth 32 used above.

# The maximum pointwise error below measures this random sample only. It is not a
# guaranteed global error bound.

ori = orientation.rand(1000, cs)

maxApproximationError = np.max(np.abs(fAngle.eval(ori) - fAngleHarm.eval(ori)))
maxApproximationError

# %% [markdown]
# The nonzero error is a truncation effect. The angle function has a cusp at `oriRef`
# and further cusps where two symmetry-equivalent distance branches tie. It is continuous
# but not differentiable there, so its coefficients decay slowly and the finite cutoff is
# felt away from the cusps as well.

# %%
plotSpectrum(fAngleHarm, figSize='small')

# %% [markdown]
# Unlike the reconstructed ODF spectrum, this spectrum retains appreciable power near the
# cutoff. That slow decay is the spectral signature of the nonsmooth angle function. In
# general, smoother functions have faster coefficient decay and need less bandwidth for
# the same accuracy.

# The section plot is smooth over most of orientation space but changes direction
# sharply along the symmetry cut loci. Those ridges are why a finite smooth series cannot
# reproduce the angle function exactly.

# ## Technical Details
#
# `f.fhat` is a NumPy vector indexed from zero, so MATLAB's `f.fhat(11:35)` is
# `f.fhat[10:35]`, and MATLAB's `reshape` fills columns, which is NumPy's `order='F'`. The
# vector holds MATLAB's coefficients; the port computes internally in the Condon-Shortley
# convention and converts at the boundary (`docs/design/harmonics.md`). `min(f)` returns
# the pair of the value and the orientation. The Dubna ODF is reconstructed here where
# MATLAB's page does the same, so the coefficients differ from MATLAB's in the digits.
