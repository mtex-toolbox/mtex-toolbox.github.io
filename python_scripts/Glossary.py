# # Glossary
#
# This page gives short definitions of terms used throughout the MTEX documentation. Each
# link leads to the page that develops the idea and shows how to use it. Terms that are
# easily confused appear together rather than in strict alphabetical order.
#
# ## Commands and stored data
#
# **Command option** and **flag** - controls appended to a command call as keyword
# arguments. An option has a name and value, whereas a flag is switched on by the value
# `True`. See [Options](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GeneralConceptsOptions_py.html) for the full calling convention.
#
# **Property** and **scan metadata** - per-element data in `ebsd.prop` and whole-scan data in
# `ebsd.meta` (MATLAB's `ebsd.opt`), respectively. Only a property is indexed and subset in
# lockstep with the map. See [Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Properties_py.html) for the definition, examples, and
# the rule for deciding where a value belongs.
#
# **Header** - scan-level information captured from a file's own preamble, in
# `ebsd.meta['header']`. It includes acquisition settings and vendor bookkeeping, but excludes
# phase and symmetry information already stored in `CSList`. It remains in the vendor's
# native shape, so field names are not normalised across file formats. See
# [EBSD Import](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDImport_py.html).
#
# **`inspectEBSD`** - the port's way of inspecting a large file without reading its
# per-point data, where MATLAB has the import option `headerOnly`. It describes the phases,
# the extent and the columns of the file from its header.
#
# ## Directions, symmetry, and reference frames
#
# **Antipodal** - the flag marking a quantity as an axis rather than a direction, so it and
# its opposite are the same thing. It changes angles, means, and densities, and nothing warns
# you if it is missing. See [Axes](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorsAxes_py.html).
#
# **Miller indices** - the notation for planes and directions in a lattice. Round brackets
# `(hkl)` name a plane, and square brackets `[uvw]` name a direction. Braces `{hkl}` and angle
# brackets `<uvw>` name the corresponding symmetric families. Planes and directions are not
# interchangeable: in quartz, the plane `(100)` and direction `[100]` are 30 degrees apart.
# See [Miller Indices](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalDirections_py.html).
#
# **Point group** - the symmetry operations that leave one point of a lattice fixed. There are
# 32 point groups.
#
# **Space group** - a point group extended by translations. There are 230 space groups.
#
# **Laue group** - a point group with an inversion centre added. There are 11 Laue groups,
# and a diffraction experiment can determine this symmetry. See
# [Crystal Symmetries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalSymmetries_py.html) for all three groups.
#
# **Reference frame** - the frame in which data is expressed. It has an identity, a basis,
# and a default plotting convention. A reference frame is distinct from both the symmetry
# attached to it and the way it is drawn.
#
# **Crystal frame** - the Cartesian reference frame fixed to a phase's lattice basis. An
# alignment such as `X||a*, Z||c` belongs to this frame, not to its point group.
#
# **Specimen frame** - the frame in which the sample is expressed. Measurement, rolling, and
# geological frames are named specimen frames. Reading a quantity in the crystal frame when
# it was written in the specimen frame, or conversely, causes nearly every confusing result.
# See [Reference System](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalReferenceSystem_py.html).
#
# **Symmetry** - the point group under which data is invariant. It is attached to a
# reference frame but is not the frame itself. Two datasets may share a symmetry while using
# differently aligned frames, or share a frame while carrying different symmetries.
#
# **Plotting convention** - the layout of a reference frame on screen, such as which axis
# points east and which points out of the screen. The frame supplies a default, and a plot
# may override it. It is not merely a camera setting because import may also use its
# rotation as a frame relation. See [Axes Alignment](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/AxesAlignment_py.html).
#
# **Frame change** - re-expressing the same physical object in another reference frame with
# `transformReferenceFrame`. The object stays fixed. Rotating instead moves the physical
# object. See [Reference System](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalReferenceSystem_py.html).
#
# **Frame-free** - the state of a `vector3d`, `S2Fun`, or `tensor` whose frame is empty
# (`None`). Its frame is resolved against the session default when drawn. An object that
# points to the default frame is framed, not frame-free.
#
# **Fundamental sector** - the part of the sphere containing exactly one representative of
# every set of symmetrically equivalent directions. An inverse pole figure is drawn on it.
# See [Fundamental Sector](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/FundamentalSector_py.html).
#
# **Fundamental region** - the corresponding set of representatives for orientations. See
# [Fundamental Region](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFundamentalRegion_py.html).
#
# ## Orientations and parent reconstruction
#
# **Orientation** - the rotation that maps the crystal frame to the specimen frame. It
# describes how one crystal is placed in the sample. See
# [Orientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalOrientations.html).
#
# **Misorientation** - the rotation relating two crystals, independent of the specimen frame.
#
# **Disorientation** - the representative of a misorientation with the smallest rotation
# angle. It supplies the number in a phrase such as a 60 degree boundary. Symmetry lets many
# rotations describe the same relationship; disorientation selects one. See
# [Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html).
#
# **Grain exchange symmetry** - the additional ambiguity for two grains of the same phase.
# Their relationship has no natural direction, so a rotation and its inverse describe the
# same boundary.
#
# **Orientation relationship (OR)** - the crystallographic mapping between a parent phase and
# a child phase.
#
# **Variant** - one crystallographically equivalent child orientation predicted from one
# parent orientation by a known OR. It is the finest classification of a reconstructed child
# grain relative to its parent.
#
# **Packet** - a grouping of variants that share a habit plane. In the usual martensite
# classification, this is the parent {111} plane to which the child lattice aligns.
#
# **Bain group** - a grouping of variants by Bain correspondence. It records the parent {001}
# cube-axis plane to which the child lattice aligns. Packet and Bain group are independent
# classifications of the same variants, not two levels of one hierarchy. See
# [Phase Transitions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PhaseTransitions_py.html).
#
# **Transform** - the first parent-reconstruction step. Each child grain is assigned a
# candidate parent orientation through the OR and changed to the parent phase.
#
# **Merge** - the second parent-reconstruction step. Neighbouring transformed grains with
# compatible parent orientations are combined into one grain footprint.
#
# **Grain graph** - a reconstruction graph with one node per grain and edges for shared grain
# boundaries. It reasons directly about grain-to-grain compatibility.
#
# **Variant graph** - a reconstruction graph with one node for every grain-and-candidate-
# variant pair. Its edges describe compatible candidates in neighbouring grains, so it
# chooses variants before merging. See
# [Grain Graph Based Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainGraphBasedReconstruction_py.html).
#
# **Fibre** - all orientations that place one fixed crystal direction along one fixed
# specimen direction. It is a curve in orientation space and a common shape for real
# textures. See [Fibres](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFibre_py.html).
#
# ## Distributions
#
# **Texture** - a material's departure from a random orientation distribution.
#
# **ODF** - orientation distribution function, the density of material over orientations. A
# single orientation has no volume fraction; a region of orientations does. See
# [ODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFAnalysis.html).
#
# **MRD** - multiples of a random distribution, the unit used for an ODF. A value of one
# everywhere means no texture. A value of 20 means that the material near that orientation
# is twenty times as frequent as randomness would predict.
#
# **Pole figure** - the density of one selected crystal direction over specimen directions.
#
# **Inverse pole figure** - the reverse density: one selected specimen direction over crystal
# directions. Both figures are projections of an ODF, and both lose information. See
# [Pole Figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationPoleFigure_py.html).
#
# **Ghost effect** - the ODF error caused by pole figures being insensitive to the odd part of
# the harmonic expansion. It is a genuine gap in what diffraction can determine, not a
# numerical artefact. See [The Ghost Effect](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFAmbiguity_py.html).
#
# **Halfwidth** - the angular distance over which each discrete measurement is spread during
# density estimation.
#
# **Bandwidth** - the highest harmonic degree kept in a series representation. Halfwidth and
# bandwidth express the same trade-off between detail and noise from opposite sides. See
# [Density Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html).
#
# ## Maps, grains, and boundaries
#
# **notIndexed** - the phase assigned when a measured diffraction pattern cannot be indexed.
# It is a recorded measurement, not missing data. Like any phase, a connected notIndexed area
# can form a grain. A patch narrower than the `alpha` closing threshold is absorbed into a
# neighbouring grain. See [Filling Missing Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDFilling_py.html).
#
# **Grain** - a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD points produced by
# segmentation. A phase change between neighbours is always a boundary. Orientation-based
# methods commonly require neighbouring orientations to agree within a threshold. There is no
# canonical grain definition, so that threshold is a convention. See [Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains.html).
#
# **Grain boundary** - one segment between neighbouring EBSD points that belong to different
# grains. These atomic segments are stored in walk order.
#
# **Phase boundary** - a grain boundary whose two neighbouring grains have different phases.
# It is a query on grain boundaries, not a separate type.
#
# **Enclosure** - the relationship in which one grain lies entirely inside another. From
# outside, the containing grain has a hole; from inside, the contained grain is an inclusion.
# These are the same fact, and the hole is never empty because even a notIndexed patch is a
# grain.
#
# **Chain** - a maximal run of grain-boundary segments laid end to end. It runs from one
# junction to the next without passing through one. Every segment belongs to one chain, and
# the same two grains lie on its sides throughout.
#
# **Junction** - a vertex where the number of meeting boundary segments is not two. It
# includes outer-map endpoints and points where four segments cross.
#
# **Triple point** - a junction where exactly three segments meet and separate three distinct
# grains. It is a strict subset of junctions; three segments meeting at the scanned-area edge
# do not make a triple point. See [Triple Points](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TriplePoints_py.html).
#
# **Closed chain** - a chain that ends where it began. A junction-free enclosed grain usually
# has one, but a chain may also leave a junction and return to that same junction. Closed
# therefore does not mean junction-free.
#
# **Gap** - a run of absent measurements within one scan line, often created by selecting one
# phase before rebuilding the grid. Grid assignment recovers its lattice positions; a gap is
# not a notIndexed measurement.
#
# **Hole in a scan grid** - a connected notIndexed area inside the region that was actually
# scanned. This is distinct from a gap and from a dummy cell.
#
# **Dummy cell** - a synthetic filler cell beyond the scanned edge that bounds the spatial
# decomposition. It has no id, never represents a measurement, and never becomes a grain.
# The cells `gridify` adds to close a turned grid into a rectangle are marked in
# `ebsd.isPadding` and are left out in the same way.
#
# **Local deformation model** - the position correction used for gaps, holes, and dummy
# cells on a nonrigid scan grid. MTEX fits an ideal affine grid and interpolates measured
# local deviations into positions without measurements. See [Scan Grids](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGrid_py.html).
#
# **KAM** - kernel average misorientation, the average orientation difference between a
# measurement and its neighbours. See [KAM](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDKAM_py.html).
#
# **GROD** - grain reference orientation deviation, the difference between a measurement and
# its grain's mean orientation. See [Mis2Mean / GROD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGROD_py.html).
#
# ## Material response
#
# **Slip system** - a lattice plane together with a direction in that plane, along which a
# crystal shears plastically.
#
# **Schmid factor** - the geometric factor relating applied stress to the shear stress
# resolved onto a slip system. It lies between zero and 0.5. See [Plasticity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Plasticity.html).
#
# **Taylor model** - the assumption that every grain undergoes the same strain. It is the
# plastic counterpart of the Voigt bound.
#
# **Sachs model** - the assumption that every grain feels the same stress. It is the plastic
# counterpart of the Reuss bound. Taylor and Sachs bound real behaviour from above and below.
# See [Tensors](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Tensors.html).
#
# **GND** - geometrically necessary dislocations, the dislocation content required by a
# gradient of orientation within a grain. See [GND](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GND_py.html).
