# # A Perceptual Inverse Pole Figure Key
#
# This page has no MATLAB counterpart: the key it describes exists only in the Python
# port. It is an option of the default key, not a replacement, and maps drawn without it
# look exactly as in MTEX.
#
# The default MTEX key, described in [IPF Maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html), places white at the
# centre of the fundamental sector and the primary colours at its corners. It does not
# change its colour at the same rate everywhere. Measured in OKLab, a colour space in which
# equal distances look like equal colour differences, the colour of the cubic key changes
# about three times as fast per degree in some parts of the sector as in others: fast
# around yellow and cyan, slow near the white centre and along the red corner. Two grains
# a few degrees apart can therefore look alike in one part of the map and clearly
# different in another.
#
# `perceptual=True` builds the key in OKLab instead, so that its colour changes at a nearly
# steady rate over the whole sector.

# The magnesium map below is textured close to the basal pole $[0001]$, which is exactly
# the red corner of the key. First the default key.

# Now the perceptual key. Its sector is the same, its white centre is the same and its
# corners keep red, green and blue; only the colours in between are placed differently.

# The red grain in the middle, the pink grains beside it and the salmon twin lamellae stay
# apart, the pale grains near the white centre differ more than before, and no single
# grain grabs the eye merely because it sits where the default key is most saturated.
# The price is visible too: yellow cannot be both saturated and as dark as the rest of the
# key's boundary, so the large yellow grain becomes olive.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Letting the lightness follow the hue
#
# In sRGB every hue has a lightness at which it is most saturated: yellow is brightest at
# an OKLab lightness of 0.96, cyan at 0.90, green at 0.86, magenta at 0.70, red at 0.62
# and blue at 0.50. A key that holds one lightness for all hues along its boundary gives
# up the bright yellows and cyans; a key that follows these values keeps them, but its
# lightness now jumps between neighbouring hues, and the colour changes fastest exactly
# there. `hueLightness`, from 0 to 1, chooses between the two.

# %%
key = ipfHSVKey(mg, perceptual=True, hueLightness=1)

plot(mg, key.orientation2color(mg.orientations))

# %%
plot(key)

# %% [markdown]
# With `hueLightness=1` the yellow grain is yellow again and the map comes close to the
# default key, slightly softer. This is not a coincidence: MTEX's key, built on the HSL
# colour sphere, effectively already places every hue at its most saturated lightness,
# and much of its unevenness is that choice. Intermediate values give intermediate keys.
#
# How even the keys are can be read off one number, the ratio of the fastest to the
# slowest colour change in the sector (the 90th over the 10th percentile of the OKLab
# colour difference per degree, at random directions of the sector; 1 would be perfectly
# even):
#
# | point group | MTEX | `perceptual=True` | `hueLightness=0.5` | `hueLightness=1` |
# |---|---|---|---|---|
# | m-3m  | 3.06 | 1.80 | 2.44 | 2.60 |
# | 6/mmm | 3.12 | 2.19 | 2.33 | 2.65 |
# | -3m   | 3.91 | 2.18 | 2.18 | 3.17 |
# | 4mm   | 3.07 | 1.81 | 2.47 | 2.96 |
#
# The mean colour change per degree, the contrast the key gives, is about the same for all
# of them: 0.023 for the perceptual cubic key and 0.022 for MTEX's.

# ## Other point groups
#
# The option applies wherever the default key does, for every point group and for the
# groups without inversion, whose sector the key splits into a white and a dark half.

# ## The maths behind the perceptual key
#
# The sector geometry is the one of the default key: every direction gets a radius $r$,
# 1 at the white centre and 0 on the boundary, and an azimuth $\rho$ about the centre,
# equalised so that the corners of a triangle land at $0$, $2\pi/3$ and $4\pi/3$. Only the
# step from $(r, \rho)$ to a colour differs. In OKLab coordinates $(L, a, b)$ with the
# chroma $C$ and the hue $h$, $a = C\cos h$, $b = C\sin h$,
#
# $$L = L_w + (L_b(h) - L_w)\,(1 - r), \qquad C = C_b(h)\,(1 - r), \qquad h = \eta(\rho),$$
#
# a cone with its apex at the white centre, $L_w = 0.95$. For the groups without
# inversion the cone continues past the boundary to a dark apex at $L = 0.30$.
#
# * $\eta$ passes through the OKLab hues of red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and magenta at
#   every sixth of the turn. OKLab gives red to yellow 81 degrees of hue and yellow to green
#   only 33, so a hue turning evenly with $\rho$ would give red two thirds of that side of
#   the sector.
# * $L_b(h)$ is 0.62 for every hue at `hueLightness=0` and moves to the lightness of the
#   hue's largest saturation as `hueLightness` goes to 1.
# * $C_b(h)$ is, at each hue, the largest chroma for which the whole cone stays inside the
#   sRGB gamut, so the key is never clipped.
#
# Along the radius the lightness and the chroma both change linearly, and along the arc
# the hue does, so for a fixed hue the colour changes at a constant rate. What remains
# uneven comes from $C_b(h)$ and $L_b(h)$ varying with the hue, and from the sector
# geometry itself.

# ## Technical Details
#
# The spread numbers are measured on the colour keys directly, with 8000 random
# directions of the fundamental sector and two perpendicular steps of 0.15 degrees; the
# test `test_the_perceptual_key` in `tests/test_directionkeys.py` checks their order.
# The tables $L_b(h)$ and $C_b(h)$ are computed once per value of `hueLightness`, on first
# use. OKLab is the colour space of B. Ottosson, [A perceptual color space for image
# processing](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/), 2020.

# ## Next
#
# [IPF Maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html) develops the default key this page varies.
# [Sharp Color Keys](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSharpPlot_py.html) spends the whole key on a small orientation range.
