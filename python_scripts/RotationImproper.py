# # Improper Rotations
#
# A proper rotation preserves lengths, angles, and handedness. An *improper rotation* also
# preserves lengths and angles, but changes a right-handed object into its mirror image.
# The name is historical: improper does not mean invalid, and such a transformation cannot
# be made by physically turning a rigid object.
#
# This page assumes the active action `rot * v` and the matrix representation introduced
# in [Defining Rotations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationDefinition_py.html).
#
# Proper and improper transformations together form the orthogonal group O(3). Its proper
# part is the rotation group SO(3). MTEX stores both: a proper element is a
# [rotation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/rotation.rotation.html), and an [orthogonalTransform](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orthogonalTransform.html)
# records which part an element belongs to with an inversion flag.

# ## The Inversion
#
# The inversion sends every direction to its opposite. The named constructor is
# [rotation.inversion](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/rotation.inversion.html).

# %%
I = rotation.inversion

# %%
I * vector3d.X

# %% [markdown]
# The result is $(-1,0,0)$. Unary minus on a `rotation` toggles its inversion flag, so the
# inversion can also be written as the negative identity.

# %%
I == -rotation.id

# %% [markdown]
# Do not confuse unary minus with [inv](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/quaternion.inv.html). `inv(turn)` undoes a turn,
# whereas `-turn` combines the same proper part with the inversion. The first result below
# is proper and the second is improper.

# %%
turn = rotation.byAxisAngle(vector3d.Z, 30 * degree)

# %%
cat(inv(turn), -turn).isImproper

# ## Reflection in a Plane
#
# A reflection leaves every direction in its mirror plane fixed and reverses the component
# normal to the plane. In MTEX, [reflection](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/reflection.html) takes the plane normal as its
# argument.

# %%
planeNormal = vector3d(1, 1, 1)
mir = reflection(planeNormal)

# %% [markdown]
# The same transformation is a half turn about the plane normal followed by the
# inversion.

# %%
mir == -rotation.byAxisAngle(planeNormal, 180 * degree)

# %% [markdown]
# The direction $(1,-1,0)$ is perpendicular to the normal and therefore lies in the mirror
# plane. It is unchanged.

# %%
mir * vector3d(1, -1, 0)

# %% [markdown]
# The plane normal is perpendicular to the mirror and changes sign.

# %%
mir * planeNormal

# %% [markdown]
# The grey patch below is the mirror plane. The black direction and its red image have
# equal components within the plane and opposite components along the blue normal.

# %%
n = normalize(planeNormal)
v = normalize(vector3d(1, -0.2, 0.5))
mirroredV = mir * v

# %%
plot(plane3d(n, 0), faceColor=[0.75, 0.75, 0.75], edgeColor='none')
hold(True)
arrow3d(v, faceColor='black')
arrow3d(mirroredV, faceColor='red')
arrow3d(n, faceColor='blue')
hold(False)

# ## Parity under Composition
#
# [isImproper](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orthogonalTransform.isImproper.html) reports whether a transformation
# reverses handedness. A single reflection is improper, whereas composing two reflections
# restores handedness.

# %%
mirrorX = reflection(vector3d.X)
mirrorY = reflection(vector3d.Y)

# %%
cat(mirrorX, mirrorX * mirrorY).isImproper

# %% [markdown]
# The two-reflection product is the proper half turn about Z. Their angular difference is
# zero degrees.

# %%
angle(mirrorX * mirrorY, rotation.byAxisAngle(vector3d.Z, 180 * degree)) / degree

# ## Improper Operations in Crystal Symmetry
#
# Crystal point groups may contain both kinds of operation. For the mixed point group
# $\bar{4}m2$, the displayed values are the total number of operations, the number of
# proper operations, and the number of improper operations.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('-4m2')
ops = orthogonalTransform(cs)
improperFlags = ops.isImproper

# %%
[len(ops), np.sum(~improperFlags), np.sum(improperFlags)]

# %% [markdown]
# Only the proper operations are physical turns that superpose the crystal on itself.
# [properSubGroup](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/symmetry.properSubGroup.html) retains those four operations. Do not
# confuse it with [properGroup](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/symmetry.properGroup.html), which returns the associated
# enantiomorphic group and has eight operations in this example.

# %%
[len(rotation(cs.properSubGroup())), len(rotation(cs.properGroup()))]

# ## The Matrix Test
#
# The matrix of every length-preserving linear transformation is orthogonal. Its
# determinant is $+1$ for a proper rotation and $-1$ for an improper transformation.

# %%
proper = rotation.id
improper = rotation.inversion

# %%
np.array([det(matrix(proper)), det(matrix(improper))])

# %% [markdown]
# MTEX stores an improper transformation as a proper quaternion together with the
# inversion flag. Axis-angle and Euler values therefore describe only that stored proper
# part. Use `isImproper` or [matrix](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/rotation.matrix.html) when the handedness of the full
# transformation matters.

# ## Technical Details
#
# Where MATLAB keeps the inversion flag on `rotation`, the port keeps a `rotation` proper
# and carries the parity as the fifth coordinate of `orthogonalTransform`: `-r`,
# `rotation.inversion` and `reflection(n)` are orthogonal transforms, `isImproper` is a
# property of them, and a list mixing both kinds is one of them. MATLAB's `rotation(cs)`
# over a mixed group is `orthogonalTransform(cs)` here; over a proper group `rotation(cs)`
# works as well.
