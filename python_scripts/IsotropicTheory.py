# # Isotropic Theory
#
# An isotropic material has the same elastic response in every direction.
# Its stiffness therefore needs only two independent numbers.
# A general anisotropic stiffness tensor needs as many as 21.
#
# The engineering moduli are different ways to choose those two numbers.
# They include the shear and bulk moduli, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio,
# and the Lame constants.
#
# This page starts from one anisotropic crystal and makes an isotropic
# aggregate from randomly oriented copies. It then shows how to read,
# compare, and convert the resulting moduli.

# ## Average a random aggregate
#
# A material made of these crystals in random orientations is isotropic.
# The [orientation distribution function (ODF)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFAnalysis.html) records
# the volume fraction at each orientation.
# A uniform ODF represents the random orientation distribution used here.
#
# Random orientations do not determine one exact aggregate stiffness.
# The result also depends on how the grains are arranged.
# The Voigt model assumes uniform strain and gives an upper bound.
# The Reuss model assumes uniform stress and gives a lower bound.
# The Hill estimate is the arithmetic mean of those two tensors.

# ## Tighter bounds from a microstructure assumption
#
# The Voigt and Reuss bounds cannot be improved without more information
# about the material. The microstructures that attain them are extreme:
# they are layers of aligned crystals.
#
# A quasihomogeneous material has the same elastic properties in any region
# much larger than a grain. This extra assumption admits narrower bounds.
# The bounds are due to Hashin and Shtrikman (1962).
# The computation below follows Brown (2015).
#
# The calculation searches over isotropic comparison materials.
# Each candidate is specified by a bulk modulus and a shear modulus.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB's three outputs of `mean(C, odf)` are `mean(C, odf, 'all')` here, the Voigt,
# Reuss and Hill tensors in that order. The identity `tensor.eye(cs)` is written in the
# frame of the crystal, since a tensor without that frame cannot be added to one with it;
# MATLAB's `tensor.eye` borrows the frame of the sum. `HashinShtrikmanModulus` returns NaN
# for the comparison materials whose residual is neither positive nor negative definite,
# which the maps leave white where MATLAB's `imagesc` paints them in the lowest colour.
# The random strain differs from MATLAB's run, so do the two stresses; they agree with
# each other.
