# # ODF Characteristics
#
# An orientation distribution function (ODF) lives on a three-dimensional space, so no
# single plot contains all of it. A handful of numbers can say where the texture is
# strongest, how concentrated it is, and what fraction of the material lies near a chosen
# component. These are the quantities commonly quoted when textures are compared.
#
# This page assumes the normalization and multiples of a random distribution (mrd)
# introduced in [ODF Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html). The model constructions come from
# [ODF Modeling](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFModeling_py.html). Every ODF below has mean 1, so its integrals can be
# read as material fractions.

# ## Three ODFs to Measure
#
# The first example is a bimodal ODF. Its two normalized components have equal mixture
# weights, so the mixture also has mean 1.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('mmm')
odfBimodal = 0.5 * unimodalODF(orientation.byEuler(0, 0, 0, cs)) + 0.5 * unimodalODF(orientation.byEuler(30 * degree, 0, 0, cs))

# %% [markdown]
# The second example is a fibre ODF. It concentrates orientations around the fibre that
# aligns the crystal direction $(001)$ with specimen X.

# %%
f001X = fibre(Miller(0, 0, 1, cs), vector3d.X)
odfFibre = fibreODF(f001X)

# %% [markdown]
# The third example was estimated from neutron pole figures of quartz.
# [The Dubna Example](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureDubna_py.html) reconstructs it from the measured files. Here
# the cached reconstruction keeps the focus on its characteristics, while the measured
# pole-figure directions remain available for the plot below.

# %%
pf = mtexdata('dubna')
odfMeasured = mtexdata('dubnaODF')

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Modal Orientation
#
# A *mode* is a local maximum of the ODF. Its value is a density in mrd, not a percentage
# of material. [max](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.max.html) returns the global maximum and the orientation
# where it is attained.

# %%
peakValue, preferredOrientation = max(odfMeasured)
peakValue

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
preferredOrientation

# %% [markdown]
# The printed peak value is in mrd. The square markers show the poles of its orientation
# on pole figures calculated from the measured ODF.

# %%
plotPF(odfMeasured, pf.allH, antipodal=True, superposition=pf.c)
annotate(preferredOrientation, marker='s', markerFaceColor='black')
mtexColorbar(title='mrd')

# %% [markdown]
# In this example the markers lie in the strongest pole-density regions. That agreement is
# a useful visual check, but it is not an identity: a pole figure integrates the ODF
# along fibres, so its maximum need not be the projection of the ODF maximum.
#
# Peak values are especially sensitive to the halfwidth and resolution used to estimate
# an ODF. Compare them only when those choices are comparable.
# [Density Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html) explains the halfwidth choice.
# [max(odf, numLocal=n)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.max.html) returns several local modes;
# [Component Analysis](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFComponents_py.html) explains how to interpret them.

# ## Texture Index
#
# The texture index, also called the J-index, is the mean square of a normalized ODF,
#
# $$ J(f) = \int_{SO(3)} f(R)^2\,\mathrm{d}R. $$
#
# The orientation-space measure is normalized as in ODF Theory. The index is 1 for a
# uniform texture and grows without bound as a texture sharpens. A direct numerical
# integration gives

# %%
textureIndexByMean = mean(odfBimodal * odfBimodal)
textureIndexByMean

# %% [markdown]
# The same quantity is obtained faster and more accurately from harmonic coefficients by
# squaring the [norm](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.norm.html).

# %%
textureIndexBimodal = norm(odfBimodal) ** 2
textureIndexBimodal

# %% [markdown]
# The two printed values agree up to the quadrature error of the direct calculation. The
# measured ODF has a much smaller index, so its texture is much weaker than the model
# built from two sharp components.

# %%
textureIndexMeasured = norm(odfMeasured) ** 2
textureIndexMeasured

# %% [markdown]
# ## Entropy
#
# Entropy is another global measure of concentration,
#
# $$ H(f) = -\int_{SO(3)} f(R)\ln f(R)\,\mathrm{d}R. $$
#
# It runs in the opposite direction: it is 0 for the uniform ODF and is negative for every
# nonuniform ODF. A sharper distribution has a more negative entropy.

# %%
fibreEntropy = entropy(odfFibre)
fibreEntropy

# %% [markdown]
# Texture index and entropy both summarize sharpness, but they are not interchangeable.
# Two ODFs can have the same texture index and different entropies. Like the maximum,
# both values change when smoothing changes; report the ODF estimation choices with them.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Volume Fractions
#
# A volume fraction asks a more local question: what fraction of the material lies within
# a chosen disorientation angle of an orientation or a fibre?
# [volume](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.volume.html) integrates the normalized ODF over either region.

# %%
preferredVolumePercent = 100 * volume(odfMeasured, preferredOrientation, 30 * degree)
preferredVolumePercent

# %% [markdown]
# The printed result is the percentage within $30^\circ$ of the preferred orientation.
# Around a fibre, the same command integrates a tube in orientation space.

# %%
fibreVolumePercent = 100 * volume(odfFibre, f001X, 20 * degree)
fibreVolumePercent

# %% [markdown]
# The printed fibre fraction is large because this ODF is the chosen fibre spread with
# the default halfwidth. Integrated fractions are generally more stable than a peak value
# when the integration radius is broader than the smoothing scale.
#
# The radius remains part of the result and must be reported. Regions around different
# components can overlap, so their separately calculated volume fractions need not add
# to 100 percent. Volume fractions are what turn a density into a statement about the
# material, as explained in [ODF Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html).

# ## Technical Details
#
# `mtexdata('dubnaODF')` reconstructs the ODF from the pole figures on the spot where
# MATLAB loads a cached file, so its numbers are those of the port's `calcODF`. `max(odf)`
# returns the pair of the value and the orientation, and the product of two functions is
# `odf * odf`.
