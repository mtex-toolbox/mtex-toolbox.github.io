# # Sachs Model
#
# A polycrystal starts to yield when its grains start to slip. Predicting the required
# stress needs an assumption about how neighbouring grains constrain one another.
#
# The *Taylor model* assumes that every grain undergoes the specimen strain. Enforcing
# that strain requires five independent slip systems per grain and gives an upper bound
# on strength. The calculation is introduced on the [Taylor Model](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TaylorModel_py.html) page.
#
# The *Sachs model* makes the opposite assumption: every grain feels the same stress.
# Each grain slips on its best-oriented system without accommodating what its neighbours
# need. The grains therefore deform independently, the model specimen does not remain
# compatible, and the predicted strength is a lower bound.
#
# MTEX has no `calcSachs` command because the construction needs only the
# [Schmid factor](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SchmidFactor_py.html). This page turns those single-crystal factors into a
# polycrystal bound and identifies the selected system.

# ## Compute the Sachs factor
#
# Let every system have the same critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) $\tau_c$. Grain
# $i$ begins to slip when its applied stress reaches $\tau_c/m_i$, where $m_i$ is its
# maximum Schmid factor. Averaging the normalized stresses gives the Sachs factor $M_S$:
#
# $$M_S = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{m_i}.$$

# The result is 2.24 for this random fcc texture, matching the classical random-texture
# value. Thus the Sachs model predicts a macroscopic stress of $2.24\tau_c$.

# ## Compare the lower and upper bounds
#
# For comparison, evaluate the Taylor factor for 2,000 random orientations. The strain is
# volume preserving and represents uniaxial extension along specimen $x$. Taylor
# decomposition needs both signed shear senses.

# The mean Taylor factor is 3.07, again the classical value. The two models bracket the
# truth: a real random fcc polycrystal yields between 2.24 and 3.07 times the common
# CRSS. Its position between the bounds depends on how strongly the grains constrain one
# another.

# ## Inspect the distribution behind the mean
#
# The average hides the orientation dependence. Every grain has its own best Schmid
# factor between zero and the theoretical maximum of 0.5.

# The distribution is strongly skewed towards 0.5. The smallest value in these 10,000
# orientations rounds to 0.28. With twelve systems available, all of them are badly
# aligned only for a very particular orientation.
#
# The vector `active` records which system was chosen in every grain. A Sachs calculation
# therefore predicts which slip trace should appear in the microscope. That prediction
# can be checked directly, unlike the idealized yield-stress bound itself.
