# # Boundary Curvature
#
# Curvature measures how sharply a boundary trace bends. A straight stretch has zero
# curvature, while a tightly rounded stretch has a large magnitude. The sign records the
# direction of the bend and therefore needs an oriented walk along the boundary.
#
# MTEX stores a grain boundary as short segments between neighbouring EBSD measurements
# that belong to different grains. A *chain* is a maximal run of these segments laid end
# to end, from one junction to the next.
#
# This page assumes that grains have already been reconstructed as in
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html).
# [Grain Boundary Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryProperties_py.html) introduces segments, chains, and
# the two grain IDs stored beside each segment.
#
# The [curvature](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grainBoundary.curvature.html) is the reciprocal of a local circle
# radius. Its unit is therefore the inverse of the EBSD coordinate unit, usually 1/µm. A
# circle of radius 2 has constant curvature magnitude 1/2. The closing maths section gives
# the precise three-point definition.

# Blue and red mark opposite bending directions. The nearly straight sides fade towards
# white, while sharp notches reach the ends of the colour scale. The fixed range clips
# magnitudes above 0.25, so saturated colour means at least that magnitude rather than
# exactly 0.25.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Sign of the Curvature
#
# Boundary segments are stored in walk order. The grain in the first column of
# `gB.grainId` lies to the left of the walk direction; see
# [Boundary Misorientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryMisorientations_py.html).
#
# Positive curvature means that the boundary bulges into the grain in the second column.
# Negative curvature means that it bulges into the grain in the first column. The first
# five segments of grain 4 show the column order.

# %%
grainIdPairs = grains['id', 4].boundary.grainId[:5]
grainIdPairs

# %% [markdown]
# Every row is `[1 4]`. All selected shapes sit inside the large background grain 1, which
# occupies the first column along each outer boundary. Grain 4 is convex, so its outer
# boundary bulges into grain 1, the grain in the *first* column. Its curvature is
# therefore negative throughout.
#
# This storage convention explains why most convex parts in the first figure are blue,
# while notches and enclosed grains are red. Grain 5 lies inside the hole of the
# ring-shaped grain 3 and is stored the other way around, with the enclosed grain in the
# first column.
#
# The column order is not an intrinsic property of an unoriented boundary. It follows from
# the direction in which each chain is walked. The [flip](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grainBoundary.flip.html) command
# reverses the walk, swaps the two columns, and changes the sign of the curvature.

# The normalized sums are about -1.02 and 1.02. Reversing the walk changes only the sign.
# A smooth simple closed curve has a total turning of $\pm 2\pi$; the small offset here
# comes from the discrete approximation.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Curvature With Respect to a Specific Grain
#
# Selecting one grain does not change the storage order of its boundary. The requested
# grain may still occupy either column of `grainId`.
#
# To read convexity relative to one grain, put that grain in the first column for every
# segment. Flip exactly the segments on which it is currently in the second column. That
# grain then lies to the left of the walk everywhere. Positive curvature then marks a
# convex part of that grain, while negative curvature marks a notch.

# ## Undefined Segments and the Two Smoothing Steps
#
# MTEX computes a segment's curvature from its midpoint and the midpoints of its two
# neighbours in the same chain. An end segment of an open chain has a neighbour on only
# one side, so its curvature is `NaN`. Closed chains wrap around and have curvature at
# every segment.
#
# All complete chains above are closed. An arbitrary subset of segments is generally open,
# however. The first 100 segments have two undefined ends.

# Two different operations are called smoothing here. The earlier
# [smoothBoundary](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/grain2d.smoothBoundary.html) call changed the boundary geometry to
# suppress its pixel staircase. That step matters because local curvature amplifies small
# geometric irregularities.
#
# The argument to `gB.curvature(n)` instead smooths the computed scalar values along each
# chain without moving the boundary. It defaults to 50 passes. Zero requests the
# unsmoothed three-point values.

# The thin curve follows individual midpoint triples and contains sharp spikes. Fifty
# passes retain the broad changes of sign while suppressing segment-scale fluctuations.
# Smoothing therefore changes the local peaks; compare data sets only after choosing the
# same geometry and scalar filters. [Grain Boundary Smoothing](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainSmoothing_py.html)

# The thick coloured outline marks the grain near the centre of the map. Its broad convex
# stretches carry one sign, while local inward notches carry the other. The black lines
# show the complete boundary network, and the IPF colours are only a background for

# ## What This Curvature Does Not Measure
#
# This is the curvature of a boundary *trace in a two-dimensional section*. It is not the
# mean curvature of the boundary surface in three dimensions. A single section does not
# reveal the surface away from that plane.
#
# The result also inherits the spatial resolution and segmentation of the EBSD map.
# Boundary smoothing suppresses the grid staircase but moves and resamples the trace, so
# the smoothing choice is part of the measurement rather than a cosmetic plotting choice.

# ## The Maths Behind the Three-Point Curvature
#
# For consecutive segment midpoints $\mathbf{p}_{-}$, $\mathbf{p}_0$, and
# $\mathbf{p}_{+}$, MTEX uses signed Menger curvature
#
# $$\kappa = \frac{4 A_s}{a b c} = \frac{1}{R}.$$
#
# Here $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the triangle's side lengths. $A_s$ is its signed area, and
# $R$ is the radius of its circumcircle. Collinear points give zero. Reversing the walk
# changes the sign of $A_s$ and leaves the radius unchanged.
#
# For a smooth simple closed curve, integrating signed curvature over arc length gives its
# total turning,
#
# $$\oint_C \kappa\,\mathrm{d}s = \pm 2\pi.$$
#
# The sign is set by the walk direction, as the numerical check above showed.

# ## Technical Details
#
# `curvature()` is a method with parentheses, and `curvature(0)` asks for the unsmoothed
# three-point values. `grains[596.0, 466.0]` is the grain a position lies in, MATLAB's
# `grains(596,466)`; a pair of floats names a position where a pair of integers would
# index the list. `gB.scanUnit` carries the unit of the map the grains came from.
#
# MATLAB's `testgrains` is a stored map of forty artificial shapes; this port draws its own
# map of fifteen, so the page follows grain 4 where the MATLAB page follows grain 2, and
# the enclosed grain is 5 inside the ring-shaped 3 rather than 23 and 31; the arc length
# profile is of grain 13 where MATLAB's is of grain 15. The total turning of grain 4 is
# ∓1.0244 for MATLAB's ∓1.0199 of grain 2, and two of the first hundred segments are
# undefined in both. `testgrains.mat` holds one MATLAB grain object, which the port does
# not read. The enclosed grains 5 and 7 have larger ids than their rings 3 and 2, so the
# loop draws them last and the red of their own convex boundaries lies over the blue the
# rings give the same segments; in MATLAB the rings come after the grains they enclose.
#
# On the titanium map the port keeps the small lobe below the selected grain as a grain of
# its own: its boundary to the grain is 10.55 degrees at its lowest, just over the
# threshold, where MATLAB joins the two, so the curvature runs round the triangle alone.
# The curvature reaches 0.058 per µm but is paler along most of the boundary than
# MATLAB's.
