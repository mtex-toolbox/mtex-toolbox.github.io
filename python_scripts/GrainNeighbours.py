# # Grain Neighbors
#
# Once a map has been divided into grains, it is also a network. Each grain touches a few
# others, and those connections carry information that a list of grains alone does not.
# Twins come in touching pairs, recrystallised grains are surrounded by their parent, and a
# second phase may sit at the corners between three grains of the first.
#
# A grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD measurements produced
# by segmentation. See [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) for that step and
# [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html) for the distinction between a grain ID and its
# position in a list.
#
# The same relationships are represented measurement by measurement by the
# [grain-boundary network](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainBoundaries.html). Working with the mean orientations of
# whole grains is coarser, but much cheaper on a large map.
# [Misorientation Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html) introduces the symmetry used when two
# mean orientations are compared below.

# Each coloured region is one reconstructed grain. The narrow regions with colours unlike
# their surroundings are the twin candidates examined below. Smoothing changes the drawn
# outlines, but not which grains are neighbours.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Which grain touches which
#
# `neighbors` returns an $N \times 2$ array of grain IDs. Each row is one pair of grains
# that share at least one grain boundary segment. The graph is undirected, so a pair
# appears only once.
#
# Calling the method on the indexed grains keeps pairs for which both grains are indexed.
# The outer map rim has a zero on its missing side and therefore does not create a
# neighbouring-grain pair.

# %%
indexedGrains = grains['indexed']
pairs = indexedGrains.neighbors()
pairCount = len(pairs)
pairCount

# %% [markdown]
# The printed count is the number of unique indexed grain pairs, not the number of
# boundary segments. A long shared boundary and a short shared boundary each contribute
# one row.
#
# The values in `pairs` are persistent IDs rather than positions in `indexedGrains`. Use an
# explicit `'id'` lookup whenever they select grains. Row 187, for example, identifies the
# following touching pair.

# %%
pairIds = pairs[187]
pairGrains = grains['id', pairIds]

plot(pairGrains.boundary, lineWidth=4, lineColor='b')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The thick blue outlines enclose the two grains selected by row 187. Their outlines meet
# along the shared trace that makes them neighbours.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Counting neighbours
#
# `numNeighbors` counts the distinct grains that touch each grain. It includes neighbours
# of any phase but does not count the outside of the scanned area as a grain.
#
# The option `matrix=True` gives the same complete network as a sparse adjacency matrix.
# Its row and column numbers are persistent grain IDs. For the full grain list it is
# symmetric because the network is undirected.

# %%
adjacency = grains.neighbors(matrix=True)

neighborCount = grains.numNeighbors
plot(grains, neighborCount, micronbar=False)
mtexColorbar(title='number of neighboring grains')

# %% [markdown]
# On this map the grains cut by the map edge have the higher counts: they average five
# neighbours against three and a half for the interior grains. Either count describes only
# the measured part of the microstructure, just as an observed area or shape does.

# %% [markdown]
# ## One misorientation per neighbouring pair
#
# Two grains that share a boundary have a misorientation. For their mean orientations it
# is one relationship per pair, rather than one relationship per boundary segment.
#
# A neighbouring pair has no intrinsic first grain. Setting `antipodal` to true gives its
# misorientation grain-exchange symmetry, so the relationship and its inverse are
# equivalent.

# %%
mori = pairGrains[0].meanOrientation.inv() * pairGrains[1].meanOrientation
mori.antipodal = True
mori

# %% [markdown]
# Since the pairs form an array, the same calculation handles every pair at once. Explicit
# ID lookup keeps the operation correct if the grain list has previously been filtered or
# reordered.

# %%
mori = grains['id', pairs[:, 0]].meanOrientation.inv() * grains['id', pairs[:, 1]].meanOrientation
mori.antipodal = True

# This is a grain-pair-weighted histogram: every neighbouring pair counts once, regardless
# of its shared trace length or number of segments. A boundary-segment histogram answers a
# different question.
#
# The result is not the smooth curve expected for a random misorientation distribution.
# It has a sharp peak in the 85 to 90 degree bin, which in magnesium is the signature of
# extension twinning.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Finding the twins
#
# A twin relationship is a specific orientation relationship. Here `orientation.map`
# constructs it from two pairs of crystallographic vectors that the relationship maps onto
# each other.

# %%
twinning = orientation.map(Miller(0, 1, -1, -2, CS), Miller(0, -1, 1, -2, CS), Miller(2, -1, -1, 0, CS), Miller(2, -1, -1, 0, CS))
twinning

# %%
twinAngle = twinning.angle() / degree
twinAngle

# %% [markdown]
# Its disorientation angle is 86.3 degrees, where the peak sits. Angle alone does not
# identify a twin: unrelated relationships can have the same angle. The comparison below
# measures distance from the complete crystallographic relationship and uses a 3 degree
# tolerance.

# %%
isTwinning = angle(mori, twinning) < 3 * degree
isPeakBin = (mori.angle() >= 85 * degree) & (mori.angle() < 90 * degree)

numPairs = len(mori)
numTwinPairs = np.count_nonzero(isTwinning)
numPairsInPeak = np.count_nonzero(isPeakBin)
numTwinsInPeak = np.count_nonzero(isTwinning & isPeakBin)
numOtherPairsInPeak = np.count_nonzero(~isTwinning & isPeakBin)

print(f'pairs: {numPairs}, twin pairs: {numTwinPairs} ({100 * numTwinPairs / numPairs:.1f}%), '
      f'pairs in the 85 to 90 bin: {numPairsInPeak}, twins among them: {numTwinsInPeak}, others: {numOtherPairsInPeak}')

# %% [markdown]
# Of the 251 neighbouring pairs in this map, 93 are within 3 degrees of the twin
# relationship, or 37 percent. The 85 to 90 degree bin also contains 93 pairs, but the two
# groups are not identical: 83 are twin matches and 10 are other relationships. The peak is
# dominated by twins, but angle alone does not select them.
# [Twinning](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TwinningBoundaries_py.html) pursues the complete relationship along the boundary
# segments themselves.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Pairs, and what counts as one
#
# `neighbors` normally returns a pair only when *both* grains belong to the list on which
# it was called. This is why `grains['phaseName'].neighbors()` returns relationships within
# one phase and nothing else.
#
# Sometimes the required rule is every pair in which at least one grain belongs to the
# list. That is how to ask for all neighbours of one grain. The option `full=True` switches
# to this rule.

# %%
centralId = 92

# get all pairs containing grain ID 92
centralPairs = grains['id', centralId].neighbors(full=True)

# remove the centre ID from the array, leaving its neighbour IDs
neighborIds = centralPairs[centralPairs != centralId]

plot(grains, grainColor, micronbar=False)
hold(True)
plot(grains['id', neighborIds], faceColor='black', alpha=0.5)
plot(grains['id', centralId].boundary, lineColor='white', lineWidth=3)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The grain outlined in white has ID 92, and the darkened grains are the grains it
# touches. Without `full=True` this list would be empty because no pair has both grains
# inside a list containing only one grain.

# MATLAB's `table` summaries are printed lines here, and the histogram is matplotlib's
# `plt.hist`. Rows of `pairs` count from zero, so MATLAB's row 188 is row 187.
