# ## What a Three-Dimensional Point Retains
#
# A [pole figure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationPoleFigure_py.html) shows one crystal direction and discards the
# rest of the orientation. A three-dimensional orientation plot instead assigns one point
# to all three rotational degrees of freedom. Nothing is lost, but the plot has to be
# rotated to reveal occluded points.
#
# This page assumes the crystal-to-specimen map from
# [Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DefinitionAsCoordinateTransform_py.html), the symmetry-equivalent representatives
# from [Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationSymmetry_py.html), and the rotation coordinates from
# [Rotation Representations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationRepresentations_py.html).
#
# A *plotting convention* states how a reference frame is laid out on screen. The
# convention below draws Y upward and X to the right. It changes the screen layout, not the
# orientations or their reference frames.

# ## Euler Angle Space
#
# [plot](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.plot.html) with `'Bunge'` places each orientation at its three Bunge
# Euler angles $(\varphi_1,\Phi,\varphi_2)$.

# %%
plot(ori, 'Bunge')

# %% [markdown]
# MTEX first selects one symmetry-equivalent representative in the fundamental region. For
# cubic crystal symmetry and identity specimen symmetry, $\Phi$ and $\varphi_2$ stop at
# $90^\circ$, while $\varphi_1$ still runs to $360^\circ$. Every orientation outside this
# box has an equivalent representative inside, so the reduction hides no orientations. See
# [Fundamental Regions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFundamentalRegion_py.html).
#
# The flag `ignoreFundamentalRegion` instead draws the stored representatives at their
# unreduced Euler angles.

# %%
plot(ori, 'Bunge', ignoreFundamentalRegion=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The same cloud now fills the full $360^\circ$ by $180^\circ$ by $360^\circ$ Euler box.
# The points outside the smaller box are not new or invalid orientations; symmetry would
# move each one back inside.
#
# Notice how the points thin out towards $\Phi=0$. A uniform orientation distribution is
# not uniform in these rectangular coordinates because its volume element contains
# $\sin\Phi$. A cluster near $\Phi=0$ is therefore not as concentrated as it looks.
#
# The rectangular geometry is only a coordinate chart. Do not use the Euclidean distance
# between two plotted points as their angular separation; use
# [angle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.angle.html) on the orientations themselves.
#
# ## Axis--Angle Space
#
# A second common view uses the scaled-axis vector
#
# $$ \mathbf{r}=\omega\mathbf{n}, $$
#
# where the direction $\mathbf{n}$ is the rotation axis and the distance $\omega$ from the
# origin is the rotation angle of the selected representative.

# %%
plot(ori, 'axisAngle', markerEdgeColor=[0, 0, 0.8], markerSize=8)

# %% [markdown]
# All points lie inside the automatically drawn fundamental region. Unlike the Euler box,
# its boundary is a polyhedron-like surface whose radial distance depends on the rotation
# axis.
#
# Drawing the unreduced representatives together with the region makes the effect of
# symmetry reduction explicit.

# %%
plot(ori, 'axisAngle', ignoreFundamentalRegion=True, markerEdgeColor=[0, 0, 0.8], markerSize=8)

# visualize the fundamental region
hold(True)
oR = fundamentalRegion(ori.CS, ori.SS)
plot(oR, color=[1, 0.5, 0.5])
hold(False)

# The blue points outside the red solid are the representatives that the previous plot
# moved inside. They remain physically equivalent to points within the region.
#
# Axis--angle space is the more faithful of these two views: radial distance is a rotation
# angle, and it distorts volume far less than Euler space. It still does not preserve
# volume or make every Euclidean point distance an orientation angle. Its direct geometric
# reading is why it is the default three-dimensional view for misorientations.
#
# MTEX can also draw `'Rodrigues'`, `'homochoric'`, and `'cubochoric'` coordinates.
# Rodrigues coordinates make several symmetry boundaries planar, while homochoric and
# cubochoric coordinates preserve orientation volume.
# [Rotation Representations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationRepresentations_py.html) compares these choices and their
# appropriate uses.
