# # Axis Distribution Function
#
# A misorientation has an axis and an angle. The *axis distribution function* (ADF) keeps
# the crystal direction about which the rotation occurs and integrates out the angle. It is
# the spherical counterpart of the [angle distribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/AngleDistributionFunction_py.html) and
# a marginal of the [misorientation distribution function](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationDistributionFunction_py.html)
# (MDF).
#
# MTEX represents an ADF by an [S2Fun](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunConcept_py.html). Start with
# [Theory of Misorientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html) if symmetry-equivalent rotations
# and the fundamental region are unfamiliar. The kernel smoothing used below is introduced
# in [Density Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html).
#
# ## The axis distribution of random orientations
#
# Random crystal orientations do *not* produce a constant ADF. Crystal symmetry restricts
# every misorientation to a fundamental region. The largest permitted angle depends on the
# axis direction, so some axes represent more rotations than others.
#
# [calcAxisDistribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/referenceFrame.calcAxisDistribution.html) computes this
# symmetry-only reference. Point group `432` gives the cubic example.

import numpy as np

from mtex import *

cs = crystalFrame('432')

adf = calcAxisDistribution(cs)

# Like any spherical function, `adf` can be plotted, evaluated, and integrated. The
# convenience command [plotAxisDistribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/plotAxisDistribution.html) draws the same
# density. Passing both symmetries describes a same-phase pair, while `antipodal` applies
# [grain exchange symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationGrainExchangeSym_py.html).

# The light $[001]$ corner is the minimum. The red band towards the $[101]$-- $[111]$ edge
# is more probable because the fundamental region extends to larger angles there.
#
# MTEX normalizes a density to have mean one. The numerical range and its ratio quantify
# the variation visible in the colour scale.

# %%
uniformRange = np.array([min(adf)[0], max(adf)[0]])
uniformRatio = uniformRange[1] / uniformRange[0]

# %% [markdown]
# The density runs from 0.597 to 1.565 multiples of the mean, a factor of 2.620. A measured
# ADF must therefore be compared with this reference, not with a constant.
#
# ## The axis distribution of boundary misorientations
#
# A grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels produced by
# segmentation. A grain boundary is a segment between two neighbouring pixels that belong to
# different grains. Load the magnesium map, segment its indexed pixels at $5^\circ$, and
# smooth the boundary geometry for five iterations. The plotting convention states the
# specimen frame used by this data set.

# %%
plottingConvention.default('y↑→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('twins', verbose=False)

grains = calcGrains(ebsd['indexed'], angle=5 * degree)
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 5)

# retain boundaries between magnesium grains
gB = grains.boundary['Magnesium', 'Magnesium']
mori = gB.misorientation

# %% [markdown]
# [axis](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.axis.html) selects the smallest-angle symmetry-equivalent
# representative and returns its axis in the crystal frame. The summary reports one axis
# for each of the 2803 boundary segments.

# %%
axesCrystal = axis(mori)

# %% [markdown]
# Each boundary segment contributes once by default. Passing its `segLength` as a weight
# instead estimates a distribution by boundary trace length. The $5^\circ$ `halfwidth`
# controls the spherical kernel smoothing.

# The isolated maximum is the extension-twin prism axis. Computing the underlying spherical
# density returns a peak of 30.8 multiples of the mean and prints the indexed direction at
# that peak.

# ## The symmetry-only reference for magnesium
#
# Use the two symmetries stored with the misorientation to plot the random reference for
# the same problem.

# This reference is not essentially flat. It has the broad variation caused by hexagonal
# symmetry, but it has no isolated peak at the twin axis. The comparison separates a
# preferred boundary relationship from the geometry of the misorientation fundamental
# region.
#
# An ADF has discarded the angle, so an axis peak alone does not identify a twin law.
# Confirm the complete misorientation against the ideal relation, as in [Twinning](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Twinning_py.html).
#
# ## Crystal versus specimen coordinates
#
# A reference frame is the coordinate system in which data are expressed; it is distinct
# from the symmetry attached to it. The crystal frame is fixed to the lattice, whereas the
# specimen frame is fixed to the sample. The crystal-coordinate ADF above asks which
# lattice direction is the axis.
#
# Passing two orientations separately to `plotAxisDistribution` asks where that axis points
# in the specimen frame. The two EBSD ids stored for every segment recover the orientations
# on its two sides. A segment that smoothing simplified or resampled no longer runs between
# one pair of pixels, and the port leaves its ids empty, so the pairs are read from the
# boundaries smoothed without those two stages, as the help of `smoothBoundary` advises.

# %%
gBp = smoothBoundary(calcGrains(ebsd['indexed'], angle=5 * degree), 5, simplify=False, refine=False)
gBp = gBp.boundary['Magnesium', 'Magnesium']
ori1 = ebsd['id', gBp.ebsdId[:, 0]].orientations
ori2 = ebsd['id', gBp.ebsdId[:, 1]].orientations

plotAxisDistribution(ori1, ori2, contourf=True, halfwidth=5 * degree, weights=gBp.segLength)

# %% [markdown]
# The directed axes occupy the full sphere because the stored first and second sides fix an
# order and the specimen symmetry is trivial. The single crystal direction becomes several
# specimen-frame clusters because each grain carries that lattice direction into a
# different sample direction.
#
# For an unordered same-phase population, add `antipodal` to identify opposite specimen
# directions. [Tilt and Twist Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TiltAndTwistBoundaries_py.html) uses the
# specimen-coordinate axis to classify boundaries.
#
# ## The texture-dependent uncorrelated reference
#
# There are three distinct comparisons. The measured boundary ADF is correlated because its
# grains touch. A symmetry-only ADF assumes random orientations. Between them lies the
# *uncorrelated* ADF predicted by the measured texture when grain orientations are paired
# independently.
#
# Estimate the magnesium ODF from grain mean orientations. Area weights make this a
# sampled-area texture rather than a one-grain-one-vote texture. The `Fourier` flag selects
# the harmonic representation used efficiently by [calcMDF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcMDF.html).

# %%
mgGrains = grains['Magnesium']
odf = calcDensity(mgGrains.meanOrientation, weights=mgGrains.area, halfwidth=10 * degree, Fourier=True)
mdf = calcMDF(odf)

adfTexture = calcAxisDistribution(mdf)

plot(adfTexture, upper=True, antipodal=True)
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# The texture-dependent reference has broad symmetry-related maxima, but it lacks the
# boundary distribution's sharp twin-axis peak. Texture alone, under independent pairing,
# therefore does not explain that boundary population.
#
# ## Axis and angle remain coupled in the MDF
#
# The ADF and angle distribution are separate marginals. Peaks in the two plots need not
# belong to the same misorientations, and the two marginals cannot reconstruct the full
# MDF.
#
# For an MDF $f(\mathbf{h},\omega)$, MTEX evaluates the full-angle ADF as
#
# $$A(\mathbf{h}) = \frac{2N}{\pi}\int_0^{\omega_{\max}(\mathbf{h})}
# f(\mathbf{h},\omega)\sin^2(\omega/2)\,\mathrm{d}\omega.$$
#
# Here $\mathbf{h}$ is the axis, $\omega$ is the angle, and $N$ accounts for the symmetry
# copies represented by the fundamental region. The upper limit $\omega_{\max}(\mathbf{h})$
# is why a uniform MDF has a non-constant ADF.
#
# [calcAxisDistribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcAxisDistribution.html) accepts `minAngle` and
# `maxAngle` to study an angle window. Its `resolution` option is the angular quadrature
# step; reduce it when a narrow window must be integrated to better than percent accuracy.
#
# The axis-angle description is singular at zero angle. Small orientation errors can
# therefore produce large axis errors for low-angle rotations. Restrict the angle range
# before interpreting a low-angle axis maximum.

# ## Next
#
# [Angle Distribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/AngleDistributionFunction_py.html) keeps the angle and integrates out
# the axis. Return to [Misorientation Distribution Function](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationDistributionFunction_py.html)
# when the coupling between axis and angle matters. Continue to
# [Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainBoundaries.html) when the boundary plane and trace must be
# considered as well.
#
# ## Technical Details
#
# The symmetry-only ADF is computed in closed form here, from the largest angle of the
# fundamental region about each axis, where MTEX expands it in harmonics up to bandwidth
# 500. The exact minimum and maximum are 0.598 and 1.578; the expansion rounds the maximum
# down to 1.565.
#
# Which side of a segment is first follows the numbering of the grains, the smaller id
# first. MATLAB numbers the grains along the y rows of the map first, the port along x, so
# many segments swap sides between the two and the directed specimen-frame axes of those
# segments reverse; the picture above differs from MATLAB's by that, while every
# undirected distribution on this page agrees.
