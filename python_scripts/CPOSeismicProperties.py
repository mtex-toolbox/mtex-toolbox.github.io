# # Seismic Properties of a Multiphase CPO
#
# This page turns an EBSD map into the stiffness tensor and seismic-wave
# plots of a polycrystalline aggregate. The required inputs are the phase
# proportions, the crystal orientations, one single-crystal stiffness tensor
# per phase, and the corresponding densities. The result connects a
# crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) to directional wave speeds.
#
# The worked sequence has four steps: place the map in its external reference
# frame, define the phase tensors, average them over the measured
# orientations, and inspect the aggregate seismic plots.

# The map contains Forsterite, Enstatite, and Diopside. Its display reports
# approximately 62% Forsterite, 11% Enstatite, 3.7% Diopside, and 24%
# notIndexed pixels. For an elastic aggregate, the phase proportions must be
# normalized over the indexed pixels because no orientation or phase tensor
# is available for the notIndexed measurements.

# ## Place the map in the external reference frame
#
# In the imported map, the foliation runs north--south. Standard geoscience
# CPO plots and physical-property plots instead use an external reference
# frame with vertical east--west foliation and horizontal east--west
# lineation. Rotating the complete dataset by 90 degrees about the
# $z$-axis moves both its positions and its orientations into that frame.

# The next command puts $x$ towards north for a better screen fit. It changes
# the session-wide plotting convention, so the map, pole figures, and tensor
# plots below all use the same screen directions.

# in GPa. The crystal symmetry records the lattice parameters and the crystal
# reference frame in which those coefficients were measured. The density is
# in $\mathrm{g/cm}^3$ so that [velocity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/stiffnessTensor.velocity.html)
# returns km/s.

# ## Match the tensor and EBSD crystal frames
#
# The published Diopside lattice parameters differ from those of the measured
# phase by about 2%. [calcTensor](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcTensor.html) matches a phase tensor
# by mineral name, Laue group, and lattice parameters. It accepts at most 1%
# relative deviation in the lattice axes and 0.01 rad in the lattice angles,
# so it deliberately rejects this near match.
#
# The remedy is [transformReferenceFrame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/tensor.transformReferenceFrame.html).
# A frame change re-expresses the same physical tensor in the crystal frame of
# the measured phase; it does not rotate the crystal or change its elastic
# response.

# ## Average orientation distributions phase by phase

# A phase may be selected by an unambiguous initial, as above. Use the full

# The ODF-based plot should reproduce the broad pattern of the direct EBSD
# average. It need not be identical because the 10 degree kernel smooths each
# measured orientation distribution before the tensor is averaged.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB's `ebsd('f')` is `ebsd['f']` here, `rot * ebsd` turns the positions and the
# orientations together, and the three outputs of `calcTensor` and of `mean` are asked for
# with `'all'`, as Python cannot count the outputs a caller takes. MATLAB's list
# `[CVoigt_ol, CVoigt_opx, CVoigt_cpx]` is `cat(...)`, which keeps one density per tensor for
# the weighted mean; the Hill tensor of the three ODF averages, its density 3.3449 and its
# entries agree with MATLAB's to every digit shown. The anisotropies of the three overview
# plots agree to the digit; where two extrema of a panel are nearly equal, as the minima of
# the S-wave anisotropy of the ODF average, the port and MATLAB may mark different ones, and
# an extremum on the rim is marked at both of its ends.
