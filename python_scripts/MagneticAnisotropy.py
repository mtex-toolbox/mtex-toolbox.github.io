# # Magnetic Anisotropy
#
# Magnetocrystalline anisotropy makes some directions in a crystal easier to magnetize
# than others. For cubic iron-silicon with a positive first anisotropy constant, the easy
# directions are the $\langle100\rangle$ crystal directions.
#
# Texture turns this crystal-scale property into a specimen-scale one. When many easy
# directions lie near one specimen direction, less energy is needed to align the magnetic
# moments along it.
#
# This page calculates the average anisotropy energy of a model electrical steel from its
# orientation distribution function (ODF). It then uses an empirical relation to estimate
# $J_{50}$, the magnetic polarization at a field strength of 5000 A/m. The result is a
# texture-based estimate, not a measured magnetization curve.
#

# Witte, Salzgitter Mannesmann Forschung, contributed the original example in March 2020.

# ## Define the material and its texture

# A reference frame is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. Electrical
# steel is a rolled sheet, so its specimen frame has rolling direction (RD) along x,
# transverse direction (TD) along y, and sheet normal (ND) along z. The second call
# states the deliberate plotting convention in which RD points right and TD points up.

# ## Read the texture before calculating the property
#
# An ODF is a material-volume density over crystal orientations. This model concentrates
# that density within a 10 degree halfwidth of Goss.
#
# A Goss orientation is $(110)[001]$: the $(110)$ plane lies in the sheet and $[001]$
# lies along RD. The pole figure shows where the cubic $\{100\}$ easy directions occur in
# the specimen. Its colour scale is in multiples of a random distribution (mrd).

# %% [markdown]
# One $\{100\}$ pole lies at RD, and appears at both the left and the right edge because
# the plot is antipodal. The other two easy axes project halfway between TD and ND. All
# three peak at the same density, since the three $\langle100\rangle$ directions are
# symmetrically equivalent. A field along RD is therefore close to an easy axis for most
# orientations, while a field along TD lies between easy axes.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Evaluate directions in the sheet plane
#
# The field turns from RD to TD in 5 degree steps. Each
# [orientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.orientation.html) maps crystal coordinates into specimen
# coordinates, so its inverse maps the specimen field direction into the crystal frame.
# The code operates on all 10000 sampled orientations at once; only the list of field
# directions needs a loop.

# RD has the lowest mean energy and the highest predicted $J_{50}$. The energy rises as
# the field leaves the Goss $[001]$ direction and reaches a broad maximum between RD and
# TD. The lower panel is the inverse of the upper trend because the empirical relation is

# ## Why symmetry=False is required
#
# The first-order energy density for a cubic crystal is
#
# $$ E_a=K_1\left(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2+ \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2+\alpha_3^2\alpha_1^2\right), $$
#
# where $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, and $\alpha_3$ are the direction cosines between the
# magnetization and the three crystal axes. The expression is invariant when cubic
# symmetry permutes or reverses those axes.
#
# The three cosines still have to be evaluated separately. Without `symmetry=False`,
# [dot](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.dot.html) compares a direction with symmetrically equivalent Miller
# directions and returns the best match. That would replace the three components
# required by the equation with three symmetry-reduced comparisons.

# %% [markdown]
# ## What this estimate leaves out
#
# This page evaluates the quartic energy law directly rather than creating an MTEX
# `tensor` object. The orientation and ODF supply the frame changes and the texture
# average.
#
# The model retains composition, crystal anisotropy, and texture. It omits domain-wall
# motion, demagnetizing fields, stress, and magnetostriction. Grain size, defects, and
# cutting damage are also absent. Those effects can change a real magnetization curve
# even when the ODF is unchanged.
#
# The $J_{50}$ correlation was fitted to non-oriented electrical steels. The sharply
# Goss-centred ODF used here makes the directional mechanism easy to see, but it does not
# validate the fit for a commercial grain-oriented grade. Compare an estimate with
# measurements made under a stated standard before using it as a material property.
