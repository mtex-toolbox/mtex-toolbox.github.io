# # Reconstructing the Dubna Quartz ODF
#
# This page follows a three-file subset of the seven bundled Dubna pole figures from their
# files to a reconstructed orientation distribution function (ODF), then checks its fit.
# Florian Wobbe measured the quartz specimen at Dubna in 2005 using neutron diffraction,
# as recorded in the
# [original MTEX Dubna example](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/HomepageOld/files/doc/dubna_demo.html).
#
# The example brings together the import, inspection, reconstruction, and validation steps
# developed earlier in this chapter. It assumes the pole-figure idea from
# [Pole Figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureAnalysis.html), the import model from
# [Import](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureImport_py.html), and the inversion workflow from
# [ODF Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html). The origin of the ghost effect is explained
# in [The Ghost Effect](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFAmbiguity_py.html).
#
# A plotting convention states how the specimen reference frame is drawn. This data set
# uses Y upward and X to the right. The convention does not rotate the specimen directions
# or change their intensities.

# ## Import the three measurements
#
# Quartz is trigonal. The lattice parameters below define its crystal frame as well as the
# metric used to interpret the four-index notation introduced in
# [Miller Indices](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalDirections_py.html).

# %%
CS = crystalFrame('-3m', [4.9, 4.9, 5.4])

dubnaFiles = mtexdatafile('dubna')
fname = [dubnaFiles[1], dubnaFiles[2], dubnaFiles[6]]

# crystal-plane normals, one entry per measured file
h = [Miller(1, 0, -1, 0, CS), Miller([[0, 1, -1, 1], [1, 0, -1, 1]], CS), Miller(1, 1, -2, 2, CS)]

# relative structure coefficients, in the same order as h
c = [1, [0.52, 1.23], 1]

# %% [markdown]
# The second diffraction peak contains the unresolved $(01\bar{1}1)$ and $(10\bar{1}1)$
# reflections. Its measured intensity is therefore a weighted superposition of two pole
# figures, not a fourth measurement. Passing `c` at import makes that same weighted sum
# part of the forward model used during reconstruction. See
# [Import](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureImport_py.html) for how the structure coefficients are found.

# %%
pf = PoleFigure.load(fname, h, CS, interface='dubna', superposition=c)
pf

# %% [markdown]
# The summary reports three entries on identical $72 \times 19$ direction grids. The
# double Miller label on the second entry confirms that its two reflections have not been
# mistaken for separate measurements.

# %%
plot(pf)
mtexColorbar(title='intensity')

# %% [markdown]
# The three panels contain sharp maxima in different specimen directions. The second panel
# has a much larger raw intensity range, which is why the solver estimates one scale
# factor per pole figure. These counts are not yet pole densities in multiples of a random
# distribution (mrd); see [ODF Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inspect the stored data
#
# The object exposes the measured intensities, crystal-plane normals, and specimen
# directions as ordinary arrays. Different pole figures can use different direction grids,
# so [PoleFigure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.PoleFigure.html) also provides the list-valued properties
# `allI`, `allH`, and `allR`.

# %%
I = pf.intensities
latticeDirections = pf.h
specimenDirections = pf.r

# %% [markdown]
# Minimum and maximum intensities give a first scale check. The rows follow the three
# entries in the object summary above.

# %%
poleFigureLabel = ['(10-10)', '(01-11)+(10-11)', '(11-22)']
print(f'{"":20s}{"minimum":>10s}{"maximum":>10s}')
for label, lo, hi in zip(poleFigureLabel, min(pf), max(pf)):
  print(f'{label:20s}{lo:10.1f}{hi:10.1f}')

# %% [markdown]
# [isOutlier](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.isOutlier.html) compares every measurement with its
# neighbourhood. Use it to create a mask for inspection:
#
#     outlierMask = isOutlier(pf)
#
# A flag is a prompt to inspect the experiment, not permission to delete a value
# automatically. Background, defocusing, normalization, and an executable outlier example
# are in [Data Correction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureCorrection_py.html).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Select a diagnostic band
#
# High-tilt measurements are especially vulnerable to defocusing. The next condition
# demonstrates indexed selection by removing only the two rings from 70 through 75
# degrees. It deliberately retains directions above 75 degrees, so it is not a recommended
# high-tilt correction.

# %%
keep = (pf.r.theta < 70 * degree) | (pf.r.theta > 75 * degree)
pf_bandRemoved = pf[keep]
pf_bandRemoved

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
plot(pf_bandRemoved)
mtexColorbar(title='intensity')

# %% [markdown]
# The blank band is the direct visual consequence of the selection. Each entry now
# contains 1224 of its original 1368 specimen directions.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Rotate the measured directions
#
# [rotate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.rotate.html) actively moves every measured specimen direction while
# leaving its intensity unchanged. This is not a frame change and not a plotting
# convention. If import assigned the wrong specimen reference frame, correct the import
# whenever possible.

# %%
rot = rotation.byAxisAngle(xvector - yvector, 25 * degree)
pf_rotated = rotate(pf, rot)

plot(pf_rotated)
mtexColorbar(title='intensity')

# %% [markdown]
# All three intensity patterns turn together relative to the plotted axes. Their values
# and the number of sampled directions do not change.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Make a coarse reconstruction
#
# A 10 degree orientation grid and at most six solver iterations provide a quick
# consistency check.

# %%
recCoarse = calcODF(pf, resolution=10 * degree, maxIter=6, verbose=True)
recCoarse

# %% [markdown]
# The first check is always the recalculated pole figures against the measured ones above.
# Recalculate exactly the three measured entities. The `superposition` option combines the
# two unresolved reflections with their imported structure coefficients instead of drawing
# them as separate pole figures.

# %%
plotPF(recCoarse, pf.allH, antipodal=True, superposition=pf.c)
mtexColorbar(title='mrd')

# %% [markdown]
# The broad maxima occupy the same regions as in the measured panels and have the same
# relative order. At this coarse resolution that agreement is only a screening result, not
# evidence that the recovered ODF is unique. [ODF Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html)
# explains the cost of resolution and iteration count.
# [Iterative ODF Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureRefinement_py.html) shows what successively
# narrowing the kernel can gain.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reconstruct at the default resolution
#
# The final reconstruction uses the default orientation grid and kernel. Its iteration
# trace is suppressed because [ODF Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html) explains that
# output in detail.

rec = calcODF(pf)

# %% [markdown]
# [calcError](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.calcError.html) returns one regularised relative residual per
# measured pole figure. Label the values so the superposed measurement remains
# identifiable.

# %%
regularisedRelativeResidual = calcError(pf, rec)
print(f'{"":20s}{"regularisedRelativeResidual":>28s}')
for label, e in zip(poleFigureLabel, regularisedRelativeResidual):
  print(f'{label:20s}{e:28.5f}')

# %% [markdown]
# The superposed measurement in the middle fits best, at 0.18, and the $(10\bar{1}0)$
# measurement fits worst, at 0.42. A smaller residual means a better match to the measured
# projection. It does not prove that the ODF itself is unique or true.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Locate the remaining mismatch
#
# [plotDiff](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.plotDiff.html) shows the same regularised relative residual at
# every measured direction.

# %%
plotDiff(pf, rec)
mtexColorbar(title='relative residual')

# %% [markdown]
# The mismatch is scattered rather than concentrated in one patch, which is consistent
# with measurement noise. It also grows towards the rim, where the high specimen tilt
# makes defocusing correction least reliable. Both patterns are diagnostic clues, not
# proof of a single cause.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercises
#
# Working through these on the same data set covers the rest of the chapter:
#
# 1. inspect the raw pole figures and identify measurements you would not trust;
# 2. remove only values for which you have a physical reason, reconstruct the ODF, and
#    compare the [calcError](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.calcError.html) values;
# 3. reconstruct from fewer pole figures and find the smallest set that still gives a
#    recognisable texture; and
# 4. compare reconstructions with and without
#    [ghost correction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFGhostCorrection_py.html). Which fits the pole figures
#    better, and why does that comparison not identify the true ODF?

# ## Technical Details
#
# The three files are picked by position out of `mtexdatafile('dubna')`, which fetches the
# seven sample files on first use. A boolean mask in brackets selects measurements and
# flattens the grid, so the reduced entries display as a list of 1224 directions rather
# than a rectangle. `min(pf)` and `max(pf)` give one number per pole figure, and MATLAB's
# `table` is a printed loop.
