# # Tilt and Twist Boundaries
#
# A subgrain boundary is a wall of dislocations. The two ideal end members differ in where
# the misorientation axis points:
#
# * a wall of *edge* dislocations rotates the lattice about an axis in the boundary plane -
#   a *tilt boundary*
# * a wall of *screw* dislocations rotates it about the boundary normal - a *twist
#   boundary*
#
# Real boundaries can contain both characters. This page computes the misorientation axes
# of the subgrain boundaries in a map and asks what they reveal. It ends with what a
# two-dimensional section can and cannot decide.
#
# The page assumes that the map has already been divided into grains.
# [Subgrain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SubGrainBoundaries_py.html) explains the two reconstruction thresholds
# used below. [Grain Boundary Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryProperties_py.html) introduces the
# per-segment properties, and [Misorientation Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html) develops
# the angle-axis description.

# ## Reconstruct and display the subgrain walls
#
# The 1 degree threshold marks an inner boundary. The 15 degree threshold separates grains,
# while `minPixel` removes indexed grains containing fewer than five measurements.
#
# A raw boundary follows the square measurement grid, so its trace points mostly along the
# grid axes. Smoothing removes that staircase before the trace direction is interpreted.
# The flags `simplify=False` and `refine=False` retain every segment and its link to the two
# neighboring measurements through `ebsdId`.

# %% [markdown]
# The blue lines are the subgrain boundaries. Rotations of 5 degrees and above are fully
# opaque, while smaller rotations fade towards the map. The lines are not scattered at
# random. They form families across the interiors of larger grains, which is the geometry
# expected of dislocation walls.

# ## Misorientation axes in crystal coordinates
#
# A reference frame is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. The crystal frame
# is fixed to the lattice basis. In this frame, the axis describes a lattice direction. For
# an ideal tilt wall it is the line direction of the edge dislocations that build the wall.

# The scatter is too dense to show whether any directions are preferred. A
# [density estimate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html) of the same axes and its
# [local maxima](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunOperations_py.html#4) make the clustering visible.

# The two maxima are (001) and (071): rotations about the c axis and about an axis close to
# b. The clustering itself is the result. A few kinds of dislocation wall account for much
# of the subgrain-boundary population in this rock.
#
# Attributing either axis to a slip system is a further step. It is a question about the
# material rather than the data alone. Naming the system requires knowing which
# dislocation systems can be active in olivine under the conditions experienced by this
# rock.

# ## A limit of low-angle EBSD axes
#
# The direction of a rotation axis becomes poorly constrained as its angle approaches zero.
# A small orientation error can then produce a large axis error. This page therefore uses
# clusters containing many segments and looks for continuity along walls. Do not interpret
# the axis of one faint, one-segment feature as evidence for a dislocation system.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Misorientation axes in specimen coordinates
#
# The specimen frame is fixed to the sample and supplies the coordinates of this map.
# Expressed in that frame, the same axes show how the rotations associated with the walls
# are oriented in the specimen. This can relate to flow geometry, whereas the crystal-frame
# axes relate to the lattice.
#
# A misorientation alone is a crystal-to-crystal rotation and contains no specimen-frame
# information. The orientations on both sides of each segment are needed, and `ebsdId`
# leads back to them.

# The flag `antipodal` is essential because the sides of a boundary have no intrinsic
# order. Swapping them inverts the misorientation and reverses its axis, but the physical
# axis has not changed.

# The scatter still overlaps heavily, so estimate its density as before.

# ## What a two-dimensional section can decide
#
# A polished section does not reveal the boundary plane. It reveals only the *trace*, the
# line where that plane intersects the section. The boundary inclination remains unknown,
# so tilt and twist cannot generally be distinguished from a two-dimensional map. One part
# of the question can still be answered.
#
# A twist boundary has its misorientation axis along the boundary normal. That axis is
# perpendicular to every direction in the plane, including the trace. An axis parallel to
# the trace therefore rules out twist and makes tilt likely. An axis perpendicular to the
# trace leaves tilt, twist, and mixed character open because the trace is only one
# direction in the plane.
#
# The map below colours every subgrain segment by the angle between its trace and
# specimen-frame axis. Blue means close to 0 degrees and therefore likely tilt. Red means
# close to 90 degrees and remains undecided. Colour saturation follows the misorientation
# angle, so that the least reliable axes fade towards neutral grey.

# %%
# compute the angle between each trace and its unoriented axis
traceAxisAngle = angle(subGB.direction, axS) / degree

# desaturate the smallest rotations without changing their angle hue
traceAxisColor = num2rgb(traceAxisAngle, blue2redColorMap(), range=[0, 90])

# Both colours are present. A long, straight subgrain boundary generally holds one colour
# along its length, so its character can be read with more confidence. The intervening
# speckle is different: isolated one- and two-segment features can change colour from one
# segment to the next.
#
# The following calculation makes that difference explicit. It computes the standard
# deviation within every connected component containing at least 20 segments, then
# averages those deviations with segment-count weights. The comparison value is the
# standard deviation over the whole map.

# %% [markdown]
# The mean within-wall scatter is 19.4 degrees, against 22.5 degrees over the map. The
# difference is modest. Continuity along a long boundary is therefore more informative
# than the map-wide average.
#
# Deciding the red boundaries individually requires their boundary planes, which means
# three-dimensional data. A statistical argument over many traces can instead recover a
# distribution of planes, but not the plane of one segment. See
# [Grain Boundary Normal Distribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryNormalDistribution_py.html) for that
# population-level analysis.
