# # Grain Reconstruction from Voxel Data
#
# A three-dimensional EBSD measurement arrives as voxels, whether it comes from serial
# sectioning or from a diffraction technique that probes the volume. Each voxel carries a
# position, a phase and an orientation. A grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected
# region of such voxels. This page asks how the segmentation criterion changes the grains
# we measure. Unlike the simulated multiphase volume in the overview, this example uses the
# DREAM.3D IN100 data so that one phase can be coloured by orientation.

# ## Load the voxel data
#
# `EBSD3.load` reads the cell data of a DREAM.3D file into an `EBSD3` on a voxel lattice,
# the voxel counterpart of a square grid EBSD map. The voxels form a three-dimensional
# array, so `ebsd[i, j, k]` addresses one of them. Every further scalar array of the file
# becomes a property.

fname = mtexdatafile('SmallIN100')
ebsdImported = EBSD3.load(fname)
ebsd = ebsdImported.copy()

# ## Reconstruct the grains
#
# `calcGrains` works as its two-dimensional counterpart: two neighbouring voxels belong to
# the same grain when their misorientation angle stays below the threshold. Voxels are
# 6-connected. The boundary between two grains consists of the voxel faces they share, each
# stored as two triangles, so every grain is a closed surface.

# %%
grains = calcGrains(ebsd, angle=5 * degree)
print(grains)

# %% [markdown]
# The summary lists the grains with their volume. The voxel data now carries a `grainId`
# per voxel. Plotting the mean orientation colours every face on the outside of the volume.

# %%
plot(grains, grains.meanOrientation, edgeAlpha=0.1, micronbar='off')
setCamera(how2plot)

# %% [markdown]
# The colour is constant over each grain and changes sharply at the grain boundaries. The
# staircase texture of the outer faces is the voxel grid itself; the boundary follows the
# voxel faces exactly.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Volumes
#
# Every grain is a closed surface, so its volume follows from the divergence theorem and
# equals the number of its voxels times the voxel volume. The volumes of all grains add up
# to the measured box.

# %%
print([grains.volume.sum(), np.prod(ebsd.shape) * ebsd.dx * ebsd.dy * ebsd.dz])

# Most grains are small. The largest grain is worth a look on its own.

# ## Grains stored in the file
#
# DREAM.3D and GrainMapper3D files carry the grain id the vendor software assigned to every
# voxel, which the importer stores as `ebsd.grainId`. The flag `'grainId'` builds the grains
# from these ids instead of the orientations, so the stored segmentation becomes a
# `grain3d` with the same closed surfaces, volumes and boundary as a reconstruction of our
# own.

# %%
grainsStored = calcGrains(ebsdImported.copy(), 'grainId')
print(grainsStored)

# %% [markdown]
# `calcGrains` replaces `ebsd.grainId`, so the stored segmentation must be read from a copy
# of `ebsdImported`. Grain labels are arbitrary: subtracting the two id arrays would not
# measure agreement. First compare a physically meaningful quantity, the equivalent-sphere
# diameter, $d_V=(6V/\pi)^{1/3}$, for indexed grains in each reconstruction.

# %%

gStored = grainsStored['indexed']

# Similar distributions do not establish voxel-by-voxel agreement. They do show whether the
# two segmentations give similar grain sizes. To locate discrepancies, compare their
# `grainId` properties on the same slice.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Small grains
#
# A handful of voxels with a stray orientation form a grain of their own. The option
# `minPixel` removes indexed grains below a number of voxels. Their voxels are marked
# notIndexed and form notIndexed grains, exactly as in two dimensions.

# %%
ebsdClean = ebsdImported.copy()
grainsClean = calcGrains(ebsdClean, angle=5 * degree, minPixel=10)
print([len(grains['indexed']), len(grainsClean['indexed'])])

# %% [markdown]
# A cutoff is a choice of minimum resolved volume: ten voxels correspond to the volume
# below. It can suppress isolated indexing errors, but also remove real small grains. Check
# the affected regions before interpreting a loss of fine grains as a material feature.

# %%
minimumVolume = 10 * ebsd.dx * ebsd.dy * ebsd.dz

removedFraction = np.count_nonzero(ebsdImported.isIndexed & ~ebsdClean.isIndexed) / np.count_nonzero(ebsdImported.isIndexed)

# ## The grain boundary
#
# `grains.boundary` is a `grain3Boundary`. Each face records the two voxels it separates,
# `ebsdId`, the two grains, `grainId`, and the misorientation between the two voxels. Faces
# on the outside of the volume have a zero in the second column of `grainId`. The
# misorientation angle across the inner faces shows where the low angle boundaries are.

# %%
gB = grains.boundary
isInner = np.all(gB.grainId > 0, axis=1) & np.all(gB.isIndexed, axis=1)
newMtexFigure()
histogram(gB[isInner].misorientation.angle() / degree)
plt.xlabel('local misorientation angle (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('number of mesh faces')

# [Smoothing](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DSmoothing_py.html) removes voxel steps before surface measurements.
# [Properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DProperties_py.html) measures the reconstructed grains, and
# [Operations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DOperations_py.html) relates sections to their parent grains.
# [Boundary Network](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DBoundaries_py.html) measures internal interfaces. The

# ## Technical details
#
# `calcGrains` alters the volume it is given, writing its grain ids and the voxels
# `minPixel` removes into it, where MATLAB returns an altered copy as a second output.
# MATLAB's `ebsd = ebsdImported` is therefore `ebsdImported.copy()` here, and each
# reconstruction to be compared runs on a copy of its own.
