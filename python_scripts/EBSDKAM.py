# # Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM)
#
# The kernel average misorientation asks a local question: by how much does the
# orientation at one measurement differ from the orientations at nearby measurements?
# Averaging those disorientation angles gives one non-negative angle per pixel. A KAM map
# therefore highlights abrupt local orientation changes and gradual lattice bending.
#
# KAM is sensitive to dislocation structures, but it is not a direct map of dislocations
# or plastic strain. It keeps only the disorientation angle, not the axis, and a
# two-dimensional map contains only part of the lattice curvature. The scan step size,
# neighbourhood, angular precision, grain segmentation, and any preprocessing all affect
# the value.
#
# This page assumes familiarity with [grain reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html)
# and [misorientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html). Unlike the grain reference
# orientation deviation in [Mis2Mean / GROD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGROD_py.html), KAM compares a measurement
# only with nearby measurements. It says how sharply the orientation changes locally, not
# how far the grain as a whole has turned.

# ## The nearest-neighbour KAM
#
# [ebsd.KAM](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.KAM.html) returns an angle in radians. Dividing by `degree` converts it
# to degrees. The default uses first-order neighbours, applies no angular threshold, and
# excludes pairs in different grains when `ebsd.grainId` is present.

# The median is 0.60°. The colour range makes the network of large values inside the
# grains stand out as red lines. These are abrupt internal orientation changes associated
# with subgrain boundaries and other local dislocation structures. They are more than an
# order of magnitude above the background, so the weaker variation receives little colour
# contrast.
#
# Measurements whose phase is `notIndexed` have no usable orientation and therefore no
# KAM. MTEX also excludes a neighbour in a different phase.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Applying an angular threshold
#
# The option `threshold` rejects an individual neighbour pair when its disorientation
# angle is larger than $\delta$. It does not classify or remove a boundary. A 2.5°
# threshold therefore suppresses only the contributions above 2.5°; a lower-angle
# subgrain boundary can remain in the map.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# Most of the red network has gone, and the smaller colour range reveals gentle bending
# between the strongest internal boundaries. The map is also visibly speckled. The
# remaining differences are a few tenths of a degree, which is comparable with the
# orientation uncertainty of conventional Hough-indexed EBSD data.
#
# Rejecting a pair also removes it from the denominator of the average. Pixels near
# boundaries and holes may therefore be averaged over fewer neighbours. If no eligible
# neighbour remains, the result is `NaN`.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Increasing the neighbourhood
#
# One way to reduce speckle is to include all neighbours up to three nearest-neighbour
# steps away.

# The result is smoother, but `order=3` is not merely stronger averaging. It measures
# orientation differences over a larger physical distance. The median rises from 0.59°
# to 0.81° because more distant measurements have accumulated more orientation change.
# Fine structures are broadened along with the noise.
#
# For maps with different step sizes, the same order does not represent the same
# distance. The option `radius` can instead select neighbours by physical distance, and
# `weights` can weight them by that distance. KAM remains an angle average, however, not
# an orientation gradient normalized by distance. The flag `max=True` returns the largest
# eligible neighbour angle instead of the average.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Denoising before computing KAM
#
# A second approach keeps the first-order neighbourhood and reduces random scatter in the
# orientations before computing KAM. See [Denoising](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDDenoising_py.html) for the filter
# assumptions and alternatives.

# %%
# choose a total variation filter
F = halfQuadraticFilter()
F.alpha = 0.5

# denoise within the reconstructed grains and fill missing lattice sites
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd, F, fill=True)

# compute the first-order KAM from the denoised orientations
kamDenoised = ebsdS.KAM(threshold=2.5 * degree) / degree

# For this example, this is the map to use when examining weak continuous structure. Its
# median is well below half the 0.59° obtained with thresholding alone. The surviving
# features run continuously through the grains rather than appearing as isolated pixels,
# which is consistent with local deformation structures.
#
# The numerical drop does not prove that more than half of the original KAM was
# measurement error. Denoising changes noise and real signal together, and its parameters
# affect both. Compare KAM values quantitatively only when acquisition step size,
# neighbourhood, threshold, segmentation, and preprocessing are controlled.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The definition
#
# Write $o_{i,j}$ for the orientation at pixel $(i,j)$ and $N(i,j)$ for the eligible
# neighbours counted there. For the unweighted mean,
#
# $$\mathrm{KAM}_{i,j} = \frac{1}{|N(i,j)|}\sum_{(k,l) \in N(i,j)} \omega(o_{i,j}, o_{k,l})$$
#
# Here $\omega$ is the disorientation angle between two orientations, and
# $\lvert N(i,j)\rvert$ is the number of eligible neighbours. MTEX constructs $N(i,j)$
# from the following choices:
#
# * neighbours up to order $n$, meaning $n$ steps on the scan grid
# * or neighbours within a physical radius
# * only indexed neighbours belonging to the same phase
# * only neighbours in the same reconstructed grain when `grainId` exists
# * only neighbours at or below the threshold angle $\delta$
#
# Denoising changes the orientations $o_{i,j}$ before this calculation; it does not
# change the definition of $N(i,j)$. The diagrams number the graph distance from the
# centre pixel. Notice that the square grid grows as a diamond of four-neighbour steps,
# while the hexagonal grid grows in six-sided rings.
