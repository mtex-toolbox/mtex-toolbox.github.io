# # Spatial Transforms
#
# A spatial transform maps positions in one coordinate system to positions in another. It
# can describe the distortion between an EBSD map and an SEM image, stage drift during a
# scan, or the foreshortening of a tilted surface.
#
# This is different from a *reference frame*, the coordinate system in which specimen or
# crystal data are expressed. A spatial transform moves map positions but does not correct
# the orientations stored at those positions. Use
# [Reference Frame Alignment](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDReferenceFrame_py.html) when the map coordinates and Euler
# angles do not refer to the same specimen frame.
#
# A function can move positions too. A [spatialTransform](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransform.html) also
# composes, inverts, displays itself, fits measured point pairs, and can be stored for
# another data set. [Maps and Images](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDMapsAndImages_py.html) explains how two images first
# come to share a specimen coordinate system and array layout.

# ## Direction Is the Contract
#
# One rule fixes everything else: `T` maps a position in coordinate system A to the
# position of the same physical point in coordinate system B.
#
# The product `T2 * T1` reads in matrix order, so `T1` is applied first. Filling a regular
# output grid uses `inv(T)` rather than `T`. For each target pixel, the resampler has to ask
# where it came from, not where it goes.
#
# Spatial transforms are two dimensional. They act on $x$ and $y$ and leave $z$ unchanged.

# ## Choose the Smallest Model That Describes the Distortion
#
# Each class represents a different amount and pattern of spatial freedom. The names are
# historical, so read their meanings rather than guessing from them:
#
# * [spatialTransformId](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformId.html) means that nothing separates the two
#   coordinate systems.
# * [spatialTransformRigid](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformRigid.html) is one translation, the same
#   everywhere. It does not include a rotation.
# * [spatialTransformShift](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformShift.html) is a full 2D affine map:
#   translation, rotation, scale, and shear in one homogeneous matrix.
# * [spatialTransformProjective](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformProjective.html) is a homography. It keeps
#   lines straight, but parallel lines need not remain parallel, as in a perspective view
#   of a tilted plane.
# * [spatialTransformTilt](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformTilt.html) is the staged model used to recover
#   specimen tilt from repeatedly correlated image pairs.
# * [spatialTransformPoly](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformPoly.html) describes a displacement that varies
#   polynomially across the coordinate system.
# * [spatialTransformDrift](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformDrift.html) varies only along the slow scan
#   direction. It models rolling-shutter-like scan drift rather than an arbitrary smooth
#   field.
# * [spatialTransformField](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformField.html) stores measured displacements and
#   interpolates between their positions without imposing a parametric model.
# * [spatialTransformHandle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformHandle.html) wraps a function when none of the
#   fitted models applies.
#
# Start with the least flexible model that has a physical reason to be present. A flexible
# model can follow noise and may extrapolate badly beyond the point pairs. Correspondences
# should span the area that will be transformed, and residuals should also be checked at
# withheld landmarks.
#
# Differently modelled hops can be stored in one list. Such a list is an ordered sequence
# of hops, not a set of alternatives. It is primarily a container: combine the required
# hops or process them one at a time before calling methods such as `inv` on them.

# ## Fit a Transform From Two Point Sets
#
# A transform is usually measured rather than written down. Locate the same features in
# both coordinate systems, then ask the chosen class for the member of its family that maps
# the first set onto the second. The two sets must use the same length unit and point
# order.
#
# The geometric minimum is not enough for a reliable fit. An affine needs at least three
# non-collinear pairs, a homography at least four well-spread pairs, and a degree-two
# polynomial at least six. More pairs let a fit expose noise and mismatches.
#
# For an example with a known answer, apply a projective distortion to map positions and
# fit the homography back from the resulting pairs.

# %%
T0 = spatialTransformProjective([[1, 0.02, 3], [-0.01, 1.05, -2], [1e-4, 2e-4, 1]])

posA = ebsd.pos.flatten()[::50]
posB = T0 * posA

T = spatialTransformProjective.fit(posA, posB)
T

# %% [markdown]
# The maximum error is at rounding level.

# %%
np.max(norm(T * posA - posB))

# %% [markdown]
# Real correspondences are not this clean. Projective and polynomial fits use Tukey
# bisquare reweighting, so points that disagree with the consensus lose influence. Here
# every tenth target point is moved somewhere else.

# %%
posBad = posB.copy()
posBad[::10] = posBad[::10] + vector3d(30, -40, 0)

TBad = spatialTransformProjective.fit(posA, posBad)

np.max(norm(TBad * posA - posB))

# %% [markdown]
# The homography is fitted after both point sets are centred and scaled to a common spread,
# Hartley's normalisation. Without it the algebraic residual of the fit weighs a point by
# its distance from the origin, and which tenth of the points is spoiled then decides
# whether the reweighting finds the transform.
#
# Other classes match their physical model: a rigid fit takes a weighted mean
# displacement, an affine uses weighted least squares, drift uses a median displacement per
# scan line, and a field keeps the samples exactly.
#
# Where a confidence per pair is available, pass it with `weights=` instead of asking the
# fit to infer every bad match. Cross-correlation supplies such weights.
#
# ## Declare a Model With + and Compose Fitted Transforms With *
#
# There are two ways to put transforms together, and they are not the same operation.
#
# `*` composes fitted transforms and simplifies where it can. It decides by value, so an
# operand that reports `isid` disappears. An unfitted prototype has zero coefficients and
# therefore reports itself as the identity. In the product below, the shift silently
# disappears and only the drift remains.

# %%
spatialTransformShift() * spatialTransformDrift()

# %% [markdown]
# `+` declares a model. It reads left to right in the order the stages are applied and
# keeps both. Only a literal `spatialTransformId` is dropped, because that class means that
# nothing separates the two coordinate systems.

# %%
spatialTransformShift() + spatialTransformDrift()

# %% [markdown]
# Use `+` for a distortion model that is about to be fitted, and `*` for transforms whose
# coefficients are already known. Here `+` chains maps; it does not add displacements as
# `+` on a [vector3d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.vector3d.html) would.
#
# Both operations flatten composites rather than nesting them, and their application order
# is consistent.

# ## Inverting
#
# Rigid, affine, projective, and degree-one polynomial transforms have exact inverses. Their
# `inv` returns another closed-form transform.

# %%
inv(T)

# %% [markdown]
# A degree-two polynomial, drift spline, or scattered field has no general closed-form
# inverse. Its inverse is a [spatialTransformInverse](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformInverse.html), which
# solves for each source position iteratively.

# %%
P = spatialTransformPoly.fit(posA, posB, degree=2)

Pinv = inv(P)

# %% [markdown]
# The round trip returns the sampled positions to rounding level.

# %%
np.max(norm(Pinv.eval(P * posA) - posA))

# %% [markdown]
# Iteration converges while the displacement gradient remains below one in the queried
# region. A field that folds has no unique inverse. Asking far outside the region used for
# fitting can also fail, and the inverse reports either failure rather than returning a
# wrong position.
#
# ## Collapse a Chain at Chosen Positions
#
# Evaluating every stage repeatedly is wasted work when the chain will be applied to many
# pixels. [discretize](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransform.html) samples a chain at chosen positions and
# returns one [spatialTransformField](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/spatialTransformField.html).

# %%
F = discretize(R + S, posA)
F

# %% [markdown]
# The field agrees with the chain at the sample positions. Between them it interpolates
# linearly over the triangulation of the samples, and beyond them it takes the nearest
# sample, so the sampling density controls fidelity.

# ## Apply a Transform to an EBSD Map
#
# [transform](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.transform.html) moves every pixel and carries its unit cell with it.
# Orientations, phase labels, and all per-pixel properties remain untouched. A spatial
# transform therefore corrects map geometry, not an orientation or
# specimen-reference-frame error.
#
# Carrying the unit cell is exact for an affine transform. For a nonlinear transform, one
# global unit cell can only represent the local transform at the map centre. The second
# argument may be a `spatialTransform` or a plain function.

# %% [markdown]
# The right map has a sheared footprint, while the band-contrast values keep the same
# spatial order. The transform changed geometry, not the property.
#
# Because this affine transform has an exact inverse, the original pixel positions are
# recovered.

# ## Where the Point Pairs Come From
#
# Nothing above measured a distortion: `posA` and `posB` were manufactured. In practice,
# pairs often come from correlating two images of the same area.
# [xcfShift](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/xcfShift.html) divides their shared region into tiles, phase correlates each
# tile with its counterpart, and returns a displacement and correlation-peak height for every
# tile.
#
# The images must first share a pixel grid, and their stored order must refer to the same
# specimen directions. With `mapImage` inputs, `xcfShift` returns positions and displacements
# in specimen units rather than pixels.
#
# The peak height is a fit weight, not a registration diagnostic. A tile on featureless
# background must not receive an equal vote:
#
#     u, peak, pos = xcfShift(imRef, imTest)
#     T = spatialTransformShift.fit(pos, pos + u, weights=peak)
#
# [Maps and Images](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDMapsAndImages_py.html) prepares that common geometry.
# [TrueEBSD Distortion Correction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDTrueEbsd_py.html) runs the complete chain on real data
# and checks the residual after correction.
