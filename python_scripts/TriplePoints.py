# # Triple Points
#
# A *triple point* is a junction where exactly three grain boundary segments meet and
# separate three distinct real grains. It is therefore a strict subset of the junctions in
# a boundary network. An endpoint at the scan rim is a junction, for example, but it is not
# a triple point.
#
# MTEX computes triple points automatically during
# [grain reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html). They are available from a grain list
# through `grains.triplePoints`, just as the boundary segments are available through
# [grains.boundary](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainBoundaries.html). The result is a
# [triplePointList](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/triplePointList.triplePointList.html).
#
# A square measurement grid can also produce vertices where four boundary segments meet.
# When analysing triple points, it is a good idea to pass `removeQuadruplePoints` to
# [calcGrains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.calcGrains.html). This converts each ambiguous quadruple point into
# two triple points. [Quadruple Points](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/QuadruplePoints_py.html) explains the resulting
# topology.
#
# This page assumes that the map has already been divided into grains as in
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html).
# [Select Grain Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundarySelect_py.html) introduces boundary-list indexing, and
# [Boundary Misorientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BoundaryMisorientations_py.html) explains the disorientations
# used below.

# ## Select by phase
#
# Phase names select triple points by the phases of their three adjacent grains. Repeating
# a name requests that multiplicity; the names do not assign an order to the three sides.
# One name therefore means at least one adjacent forsterite grain.

# Repeating the name selects points with at least two adjacent forsterite grains.

# therefore returns the points on the boundary of that grain.

# ## Boundary segments at a triple point
#
# The `boundaryId` property has one row per triple point and three columns for its
# incident segments. These values index the complete boundary list from which the triple
# points came. Here all three neighbouring grains are first restricted to forsterite.

# Colour records that angle sum in degrees. The fixed colour range saturates any sum above

# ## Section angles at triple points
#
# The property `tP.angles` returns the three angles enclosed by the incident boundary
# segments. It is an $n \times 3$ matrix, and each row sums to $2\pi$. The spread between
# the largest and smallest angle measures how unequal the three arms appear in this
# two-dimensional section.

# Pale points have three more nearly equal section angles, while dark-red points have a
# larger angular spread. These are angles between smoothed traces in the section, not the
# full dihedral angles of three boundary planes in three dimensions.
#
# In a section perpendicular to the three-dimensional junction line, equal,
# orientation-independent boundary energies at local equilibrium would give three 120
# degree angles. Unequal energies, anisotropy, drag, non-equilibrium microstructure,
# sectioning, and segmentation can all move the observed values away from that ideal. The
# angle spread must therefore not be read directly as a boundary-energy measurement.

# Continue with [Quadruple Points](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/QuadruplePoints_py.html) for the grid ambiguity resolved
# at reconstruction. [CSL Boundaries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CSLBoundaries_py.html) classifies triple points by the
# character of their incident boundaries. [Merging Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainMerge_py.html) then shows how
# selected boundaries alter the grains and their junction network. For full boundary-plane
# geometry, continue to [3D EBSD](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD3Analysis_py.html). Triple points also supply local

# ## Technical Details
#
# A tuple of phase names in brackets selects triple points, MATLAB's
# `tP('Forsterite','Forsterite')`. The port finds 78 triple points where MATLAB finds 70,
# 19 of them between three forsterite grains for MATLAB's 14, and 220 forsterite
# boundary segments become 248: the not indexed third of this map is closed by the
# neighbouring grains differently, and `alpha` does not change the closing here, as
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) says.
