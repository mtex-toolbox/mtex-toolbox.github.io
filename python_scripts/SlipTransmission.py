# # Slip Transmission
#
# Slip that reaches a grain boundary may continue on a suitably aligned
# system in the neighbouring grain. *Slip transmission* is this transfer of
# plastic shear across the boundary. It depends on the systems selected on
# both sides, so it connects the independent-grain models from the preceding
# pages to an observable grain-to-grain interaction.
#
# This page selects basal slip under uniaxial tension, maps the Luster--Morris
# $m'$ compatibility parameter on every boundary segment, and then shows how
# compatibility varies with misorientation.

# The contour plot summarizes the same points as a density. Its east--west

# ## Use an equivalent stress tensor
#
# A `stressTensor` is required for a loading state that cannot be represented
# by one tension direction. For the same uniaxial $x$ tension, however, the
# direction and tensor routes should agree.

np.count_nonzero(idStress != idActive)

# %% [markdown]
# The maximum difference is $3.33\times10^{-16}$, which is numerical
# roundoff, and zero grains change system. Although an earlier version of
# this page said that the result was "a bit different," it is not different
# for the same uniaxial load. A genuinely multiaxial stress can select a
# different system and must use the tensor route.

# ## Map compatibility on the boundaries
#
# The Luster--Morris parameter $m'$ compares the slip-plane normals and slip
# directions on opposite sides of a boundary. A value near one means both
# pairs are nearly parallel. A value near zero means that at least one pair
# is nearly perpendicular. The grain ids of a segment name its two grains;
# `id2ind` gives their positions in the list of grains.

# Bright boundary segments connect selected systems with high geometric
# compatibility; dark segments connect poorly aligned systems. The minimum,

# grain orientation alone does not imply uniform transmission through the
# map.

# ## Plot the best compatibility in misorientation space
#
# The $m'$ value is unchanged if both crystals and both systems are rotated
# together. It therefore depends on their relative misorientation. An
# axis--angle section plot can show this dependence without referring to a
# particular EBSD map.

# Fix one incoming basal system. At each misorientation, compare it with all
# symmetry-equivalent outgoing basal systems and retain the best $m'$; a
# column of misorientations times the row of systems pairs every node with
# every outgoing system.

# %% [markdown]
# The colour map runs from white at the bottom of the range through blue,
# green and yellow to dark red at the top. The dark red regions are the
# misorientations for which at least one outgoing basal system nearly
# continues the incoming one. The white regions offer no similarly aligned
# basal system. Unlike the boundary map, this plot chooses the best outgoing
# system without considering the applied stress.

# %% [markdown]
# ## What m-prime does not decide
#
# A high $m'$ is evidence for geometric compatibility, not proof that slip
# transmitted. The parameter omits the boundary-plane orientation, local
# stress concentrations, critical resolved shear stresses, and competing
# non-basal systems. Compare it with observed slip traces and with a loading
# model rather than using a universal pass--fail threshold.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The maths behind m-prime
#
# For incoming and outgoing systems with unit plane normals $\mathbf n$ and
# unit slip directions $\mathbf b$, MTEX evaluates
#
# $$m'=\left| (\mathbf n_{\mathrm{in}}\cdot
#   \mathbf n_{\mathrm{out}})
#   (\mathbf b_{\mathrm{in}}\cdot\mathbf b_{\mathrm{out}})\right|.$$
#
# The absolute value makes reversed normal or Burgers-vector signs
# equivalent. The [`mPrime`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/slipSystem.mPrime.html) method applies this
# expression element by element to paired systems.
