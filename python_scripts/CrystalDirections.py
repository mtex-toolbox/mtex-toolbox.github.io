# # Miller Indices
#
# A direction in a specimen is written in specimen axes such as X, Y and Z. A direction in
# a crystal is written relative to its lattice axes. Direct lattice directions use square
# brackets $[uvw]$, while plane normals use parentheses $(hkl)$ and the reciprocal lattice.
#
# This page shows how MTEX keeps those two meanings apart. The examples assume the
# spherical plots introduced in [Vectors](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Vectors.html) and the lattice description
# introduced in [Crystal Symmetries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalSymmetries_py.html).

# ## The Lattice and Its Crystal Frame
#
# Miller indices have meaning only together with the lattice they refer to. A
# [crystalFrame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/crystalFrame.crystalFrame.html) stores the point symmetry, lattice metric
# and crystal frame of a phase.
#
# A reference frame is the coordinate system in which data are expressed. The crystal
# frame is the Cartesian frame fixed to the lattice basis. Its basis and default plotting
# convention are distinct from point symmetry.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('triclinic', [5.29, 9.18, 9.42], np.array([90.4, 98.9, 90.1]) * degree, 'X||a*', 'Z||c', mineral='Talc')

# %% [markdown]
# The three direct-lattice axes are $\vec a$, $\vec b$ and $\vec c$. Their display
# identifies them as direct coordinates.

# %%
directAxes = cat(cs.aAxis, cs.bAxis, cs.cAxis)
directAxes

# %% [markdown]
# Talc is triclinic, so the axes are not mutually perpendicular. The angle between
# $\vec a$ and $\vec c$ is the unit-cell angle $\beta=98.9^\circ$.

# %%
metricAngleAC = angle(directAxes[0], directAxes[2], symmetry=False) / degree
metricAngleAC

# %% [markdown]
# The `symmetry=False` option is essential when reading a metric angle. Without it, `angle`
# compares symmetry-equivalent directions. Inversion would replace $\vec c$ by $-\vec c$
# here and return $81.1^\circ$.

# ## Direct-Lattice Directions $[uvw]$
#
# A direct-lattice vector is an integer combination of the lattice axes,
#
# $$\vec m=u\vec a+v\vec b+w\vec c.$$
#
# Its direction is written $[uvw]$. In MTEX it is represented by a [Miller](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Miller.html)
# with display style `'uvw'`.

# %%
m = Miller(1, 0, 1, cs, 'uvw')
m

# %% [markdown]
# The `u v w` column header in the output identifies a direct-lattice direction. The
# spherical plot places it beside the three direct axes, and labels it $[101]$.

# %%
plot(m, labeled=True, grid=True)
annotate(directAxes, label=['a', 'b', 'c'], backgroundColor='w', textAboveMarker=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The marker is the direction of $\vec a+\vec c$. The labelled axes show how its position
# must be read in this non-orthogonal lattice.
#
# A [plotting convention](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/plottingConvention.html) controls how a reference frame is laid
# out on screen. Changing it does not rotate the direction or alter its indices.

# %%
# point the a-axis east in this crystal frame
cs.how2plot.east = cs.aAxis

# %%
plot(m, labeled=True, grid=True)
annotate(directAxes, label=['a', 'b', 'c'], backgroundColor='w', textAboveMarker=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The second plot contains the same direction in the same crystal. Only the screen layout
# changed: the a-axis now points east.

# ## Lattice-Plane Normals $(hkl)$
#
# A lattice plane is represented by its normal in the reciprocal basis,
#
# $$\vec n=h\vec a^*+k\vec b^*+\ell\vec c^*.$$
#
# Its Miller indices are written $(hkl)$. The reciprocal basis is developed in
# [Lattice Metric and Plane Geometry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/LatticeMetric_py.html). `Miller(h,k,l,cs)` uses `'hkl'`
# by default, but the explicit flag makes the distinction visible in teaching code.

# %%
n = Miller(1, 0, 1, cs, 'hkl')

# A plane normal plots as a point. The option `plane=True` instead draws the great circle
# of directions perpendicular to that normal.

# %%

plot(n, upper=True, labeled=True)
plot(n, plane=True, lineColor='r', lineWidth=2, add2all=True)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The red great circle represents the plane orientation. The labels also show that
# $(101)$ and $[101]$ occupy different points on the sphere.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Why $[101]$ and $(101)$ Are Not the Same Direction
#
# The objects above carry the same three numbers but use different bases. Their geometric
# angle is

# %%
directReciprocalAngle = angle(m, n, symmetry=False) / degree
directReciprocalAngle

# %% [markdown]
# The result is about $31.7^\circ$. Direct and reciprocal axes are parallel in every
# orthogonal lattice, including orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic lattices. They
# generally are not parallel in a non-orthogonal lattice.
#
# Cubic examples therefore hide this distinction: $[hkl]$ happens to be parallel to the
# normal of $(hkl)$. MTEX still records whether a `Miller` object represents direct or
# reciprocal coordinates.

# ## Four-Index Notation for Trigonal and Hexagonal Lattices
#
# Trigonal and hexagonal lattices are commonly described with three equivalent basal axes.
# Four-index notation makes their cyclic symmetry visible. Plane normals use
# Bravais–Miller indices $(hkil)$, where $h+k+i=0$.
#
# Direct directions use the related `UVTW` convention, where $U+V+T=0$. The conversion
# between `UVTW` and `uvw` is not simply the removal of the redundant third coordinate.

# The square- and round-bracket labels identify the two meanings at a glance. The four
# basal indices also expose the required zero sums.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Display Style Does Not Change the Direction
#
# The `dispStyle` property selects how an existing object is displayed. It does not change
# its Cartesian direction. Displaying the direct direction above in three-index form
# produces fractional coordinates.

# %%
m.dispStyle = 'uvw'
mThreeIndex = m
mThreeIndex

# %% [markdown]
# [round](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.round.html) rescales the same direction to an equivalent small integer
# triplet.

# %%
mIntegerIndices = round(mThreeIndex)
mIntegerIndices

# %% [markdown]
# The output is $[541]$. The rescaling preserves the direction but not the vector length,
# so keep the original scale when a lattice translation or Burgers-vector length matters.
#
# For the reciprocal normal, the three-index display simply removes the redundant $i$
# coordinate.

# %%
n.dispStyle = 'hkl'

# %% [markdown]
# Internally, each `Miller` stores Cartesian components like a
# [vector3d](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.vector3d.html). Its crystal frame and `dispStyle` retain how those
# components should be interpreted and displayed. A direct vector stays direct when
# switching from `UVTW` to `uvw`, and a reciprocal normal stays reciprocal when switching
# from `hkil` to `hkl`.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Maths Behind Plane Indices
#
# A member of the $(hkl)$ plane family has equation
#
# $$\vec x\mathbin{\cdot}\vec n=q.$$
#
# Its fractional intercepts on $\vec a$, $\vec b$ and $\vec c$ are $q/h$, $q/k$ and
# $q/\ell$. A zero index gives an infinite intercept, so the plane is parallel to that
# direct axis.
#
# In the schematic, the $(213)$ plane is drawn with $q=6$. It meets the axes at $3\vec a$,
# $6\vec b$ and $2\vec c$. Its normal is $2\vec a^*+\vec b^*+3\vec c^*$.
#
# ![](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/figures/python/latticePlaneNormal.png)
#
# Notice that the normal follows reciprocal axes, while the plane intercepts are measured
# along direct axes.
#
# Multiplying all indices by a common factor leaves the plotted normal direction
# unchanged, but it changes the reciprocal-vector length. Consequently, $(200)$ has half
# the [dspacing](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.dspacing.html) of $(100)$. Conventional Miller indices are
# usually reduced to relatively prime integers, with additional care required for centred
# cells and diffraction reflections.
