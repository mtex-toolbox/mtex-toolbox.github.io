# # Slip Systems
#
# Crystal slip shears one part of a crystal past another by dislocation
# motion on a lattice plane. A *slip system* specifies the plane and the
# direction of that shear. This page constructs one system, generates its
# symmetry-equivalent family, and assigns strengths to several families.

# %%
from mtex import *

# ## Define one slip system
#
# A slip system combines a Burgers vector $\mathbf b$, which gives the slip
# direction and displacement, with a slip-plane normal $\mathbf n$.
# The direction must lie in the plane, so $\mathbf b\cdot\mathbf n=0$.
#
# Start with the lattice and crystal frame of hexagonal alpha-titanium.
# The four-index notation used below is introduced with
# [crystal directions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalDirections_py.html).

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('622', [3, 3, 4.7], 'x||a', mineral='Titanium (Alpha)')
cs

# %% [markdown]
# One first-order prismatic $\langle a\rangle$ system has Burgers vector
# $[2\bar1\bar10]$ and plane normal $(01\bar10)$.

# %%
b = Miller(2, -1, -1, 0, cs, 'UVTW')
b

# %%
n = Miller(0, 1, -1, 0, cs, 'HKIL')
n

# Passing the two directions to the
# [`slipSystem`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/slipSystem.slipSystem.html) constructor keeps them together
# as one physical shear mode. The constructor also checks orthogonality.

# %%
sSPrismatic = slipSystem(b, n)
sSPrismatic

# %% [markdown]
# Common families also have named constructors. For example, this creates
# one representative of the basal $\langle11\bar20\rangle\{0001\}$ family.

# %%
sSBasal = slipSystem.basal(cs)
sSBasal

# %% [markdown]
# ## Draw the plane and direction
#
# Drawn inside the crystal, the plane shows where the lattice shears and the
# arrow shows the direction of shear. The same plane with another in-plane
# direction is therefore a different slip system.

# %%
cS = crystalShape.hex(cs)

plot(cS, faceAlpha=0.4, faceColor=[0.7, 0.8, 0.9])
hold(True)
plot(cS, sSBasal, faceColor='red')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The red disk is the basal plane. The red arrow lies in that disk, which
# makes the required orthogonality of $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf n$ visible.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Generate the complete family
#
# A representative does not describe every basal system in a hexagonal
# crystal. Crystal symmetry generates the equivalent systems.
# The option `'antipodal'` identifies opposite Burgers-vector signs, because
# they describe the two shear senses of the same geometric system.

# %%
sSBasalSym = sSBasal.symmetrise('antipodal')
sSBasalSym

# %% [markdown]
# Alpha-titanium has three such basal systems. The norm of each Burgers
# vector is 3 in the lattice units selected in `cs`.

# %%

# ## Choose families and their CRSS
#
# For cubic lattices, `slipSystem.fcc(cs)` and `slipSystem.bcc(cs)` provide
# standard sets. Hexagonal lattices deliberately have no `slipSystem.hcp`.
# The active families and their *critical resolved shear stress* (CRSS)
# depend on the material, temperature, and loading rather than on the
# lattice alone. MTEX therefore provides each family separately:
#
# ```
# slipSystem.basal(cs)          <11-20>{0001}
# slipSystem.prismaticA(cs)     <2-1-10>{01-10}
# slipSystem.prismatic2A(cs)    <01-10>{2-1-10}     2nd order prismatic
# slipSystem.pyramidalA(cs)     <2-1-10>{01-11}     1st order pyramidal <a>
# slipSystem.pyramidalCA(cs)    <2-1-13>{-1101}     1st order pyramidal <c+a>
# slipSystem.pyramidal2CA(cs)   <2-1-13>{-2112}     2nd order pyramidal <c+a>
# slipSystem.twinT1(cs)         <1-101>{-1102}      tensile twinning
# slipSystem.twinT2(cs)         <2-1-16>{-2111}     tensile twinning
# slipSystem.twinC1(cs)         <-110-2>{-1101}     compressive twinning
# slipSystem.twinC2(cs)         <2-1-1-3>{2-1-12}   compressive twinning
# ```
#
# The second argument sets the CRSS of a family. This illustrative set makes
# the basal systems easiest to activate and makes the families comparable.
# Use values measured for the material and conditions in a real model.

# %%
sS = cat(slipSystem.basal(cs, 1), slipSystem.prismatic2A(cs, 66),
         slipSystem.pyramidalCA(cs, 80), slipSystem.twinC1(cs, 100))

# ## Deformation and Schmid tensors
#
# In linearized kinematics, a unit shear on a slip system contributes the
# displacement gradient $\mathbf b\otimes\mathbf n$ after both vectors are
# normalized. Its symmetric part is strain and its antisymmetric part is
# lattice spin. MTEX returns this quantity as the deformation tensor.

# %%
L = sSBasal.deformationTensor()
L

# %% [markdown]
# MTEX uses exactly the same normalized dyad as the Schmid tensor. The next
# page contracts it with a stress tensor to obtain resolved shear stress.

# ## Express a system in the specimen frame
#
# A newly constructed slip system is expressed in the crystal frame.
# An [orientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationDefinition_py.html) maps the crystal frame into a
# specimen frame. Multiplication applies that map to both $\mathbf b$ and
# $\mathbf n$.

# %%
ori = orientation.rand(cs)
