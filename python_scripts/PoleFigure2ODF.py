# # ODF Estimation from Pole Figure Data
#
# A pole figure does not measure individual orientations. Each value sums every
# orientation that places one lattice plane in one specimen direction. Those orientations
# form a one-dimensional fibre in orientation space. One pole figure therefore cannot be
# inverted by itself.
#
# Combining several pole figures adds constraints, but it still does not make the inverse
# problem unique. The practical task is to find an orientation distribution function
# (ODF) whose recalculated pole figures agree with the measurements, and then to inspect
# where they do not agree.
#
# This page assumes the pole-figure idea from [Pole Figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureAnalysis.html) and
# corrected measurements from [Data Correction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureCorrection_py.html). The definition
# and units of an ODF are introduced in [ODF Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html). Here the
# reconstruction uses [calcODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.calcODF.html).
# [The Ghost Effect](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFAmbiguity_py.html) explains what the measurements can
# never determine.

# ## Inspect the measurements first
#
# The data contain seven neutron-diffraction pole figures from a quartz specimen. One
# measurement is a superposition of two unresolved reflections.
# [Import](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureImport_py.html) explains how the Miller indices and their structure
# coefficients enter that measurement model.

# %%
plot(pf)

# %% [markdown]
# The seven panels contain sharp maxima at different specimen directions. The superposed
# reflection has two Miller indices in its title. Look for missing coverage, isolated
# points, or a pattern that is inconsistent with the other panels before asking an ODF to
# explain the data.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reconstruct an ODF
#
# With no options, `calcODF` uses MTEX's modified least-squares solver and automatic ghost
# correction. `silent=False` shows the fit error of every pole figure after each
# iteration, as MATLAB prints it by default.

odf

# %% [markdown]
# The result is an [SO3FunRBF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunRBF.SO3FunRBF.html). It represents the ODF as a
# weighted superposition of unimodal kernel functions on a grid in orientation space. The
# display reports 20,224 grid centres for this reconstruction. The object can be analysed
# like any other ODF; continue to [ODF Analysis](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFAnalysis.html) after validating the
# reconstruction.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Compare recalculated and measured pole figures
#
# The first validation is visual. Recalculate exactly the lattice planes and
# superpositions that were measured.

# %%
plotPF(odf, pf.allH, antipodal=True, superposition=pf.c)

# %% [markdown]
# The maxima appear in the same regions and reach comparable intensities. The recalculated
# pole figures are smoother because the finite-width kernels do not reproduce every
# fluctuation in the measurement.
#
# [calcError](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.calcError.html) makes the same comparison one pole figure at a
# time. The `'RP'` measure divides the absolute difference by the recalculated intensity,
# but only where that intensity exceeds the threshold supplied as `epsilon`. The default
# threshold is 1.

# %%
rpError = calcError(pf, odf, 'RP')
rpError

# %% [markdown]
# The seven RP values range from 0.36 to 0.86. Because RP is relative, weak regions can
# dominate even when their absolute differences are small.
#
# Called without a measure, `calcError` uses a regularised relative error. It divides by
# the larger intensity plus half the scale factor, so it does not divide by a value near
# zero.

# %%
regularisedError = calcError(pf, odf)
regularisedError

# %% [markdown]
# The regularised values range from 0.24 to 0.40. They are not smaller RP values; they
# answer a different question. Compare reconstructions with the same measure and threshold
# throughout. The other available measures are `'l1'` and `'l2'`.
#
# A single error vector hides where the mismatch occurs.
# [plotDiff](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure.plotDiff.html) plots the relative difference for every measured
# direction.

# %%
plotDiff(pf, odf)

# %% [markdown]
# These residuals are not scattered. In every one of the seven panels the mean residual
# grows from the centre of the disc outward, roughly doubling by the rim.
#
# Scattered residuals would be consistent with measurement noise. A pattern this orderly
# points to a systematic cause worth checking, and one that grows with specimen tilt is
# the signature of an omitted defocusing correction. An incorrect background or a pole
# figure that does not belong with the others would also leave structure. The pattern is a
# diagnostic clue, not proof of any one cause.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Comparing two ODFs
#
# The [calcError](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcError.html) overload also compares two ODFs. This is a
# different calculation from comparing an ODF with pole-figure measurements. To make the
# distinction visible, build one broad component at the strongest orientation of the
# reconstruction.

# %%
_, oriPref = max(odf)

odfDifference = calcError(odfModel, odf)
odfDifference

# %% [markdown]
# The model pole figures retain the main maxima and omit the weaker components. The large
# ODF difference is therefore expected: one unimodal component cannot represent this
# multi-component texture.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Control the discretization
#
# The solver places unimodal components on a grid in orientation space. The `resolution`
# option sets the grid spacing, while each default de la Vallee Poussin kernel has the
# same halfwidth as that spacing.
#
# The `calcODF` reference describes its default grid as 1.5 times the pole-figure
# resolution. The current `MLSSolver` constructor instead uses the stored resolution of
# the first pole figure. Pass `resolution` explicitly when that distinction matters to
# reproducibility.
#
# A 15 degree grid demonstrates the speed-resolution trade-off.

# %%
tic = time.perf_counter()
odfCoarse = calcODF(pf, resolution=15 * degree)
coarseTime = time.perf_counter() - tic

plotPF(odfCoarse, pf.allH, antipodal=True, superposition=pf.c)

defaultPeak = max(odf)[0]
coarsePeak = max(odfCoarse)[0]
meanDefaultRP = np.mean(rpError)
meanCoarseRP = np.mean(calcError(pf, odfCoarse, 'RP'))

      f'15 degree: {coarseTime:.2f} s, peak {coarsePeak:.1f} mrd, mean RP {meanCoarseRP:.2f}')

# %% [markdown]
# The 15 degree result keeps the main maxima but broadens them. The timing printed above
# shows the speed-up. Its peak is 27.2 mrd instead of 95.2 mrd, and the mean RP error
# rises from 0.59 to 0.75. A coarse grid cannot represent a sharp texture. A finer grid
# costs more time and, once it exceeds the information in the measurements, can give a
# false impression of resolved detail.
#
# Two options control the kernel directly. The `kernel` option accepts an `SO3Kernel`
# object. The `halfwidth` option keeps the default de la Vallee Poussin kernel and changes
# its width.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The zero range method
#
# If a measured pole figure is genuinely zero in a region, every orientation contributing
# there must also have zero density. The zero range method removes those orientation-grid
# nodes before solving. It can make a sharp reconstruction with large empty regions both
# faster and finer.

# %%

      f'default: {defaultTime:.2f} s, peak {defaultPeak:.1f} mrd, mean RP {meanDefaultRP:.2f}')

# %% [markdown]
# On this data set the method does change the reconstruction. The peak rises from 95.2 to
# 109.4 mrd and the mean RP error falls from 0.59 to 0.51. The timings printed above show
# that it also runs faster here, because the solver keeps far fewer grid nodes. The
# sharper recalculated maxima are the visible difference to look for. Try the method
# rather than assuming it will help. The
# [zeroRangeMethod](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/zeroRangeMethod.zeroRangeMethod.html) reference lists the threshold
# and smoothing options that decide what counts as zero.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Ghost correction
#
# The odd-order harmonic coefficients of an ODF do not appear in its pole figures, so the
# measurements do not determine them. Setting them to zero produces the *ghost effect*: a
# raised uniform background, weakened real components, and sometimes spurious components.
#
# [Ghost Correction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODFGhostCorrection_py.html) explains Matthies' remedy, which
# MTEX applies by default and which matters most for weak textures.
# [The Santa Fe Example](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureSantaFe_py.html) measures the benefit on a model ODF for
# which the true answer is known. A good fit to the pole figures alone does not establish
# that a reconstructed ODF is unique or true.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The maths behind the estimator
#
# In simplified notation, `calcODF` minimises a modified least-squares functional over
# non-negative combinations of the kernel components:
#
# $$f_{\mathrm{est}} = \mathrm{argmin}_{f} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N_i} \frac{|\alpha_i Rf(h_i,r_{ij}) - I_{ij}|^2}{I_{ij}}.$$
#
# Dividing by $I_{ij}$ makes the functional modified least squares. It weights each
# measurement by its own intensity, so a bright point cannot dominate a dark one. The
# factor $\alpha_i$ absorbs the unknown scale of each pole figure, which allows
# unnormalised intensity data to be used.

# ## Technical Details
#
# `calcODF` is silent unless `silent=False` is given; MATLAB prints the trace unless
# `'silent'` is given. The RP threshold is the keyword `epsilon`, MATLAB's number after
# `'RP'`. `max(odf)` returns the pair of the value and the orientation, so the peak is its
# first element and the mode its second.
