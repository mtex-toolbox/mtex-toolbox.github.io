# # Harmonic Representation of Spherical Functions
#
# A spherical harmonic representation replaces a function by coefficients of standard
# wave-like patterns on the sphere. This is the spherical counterpart of representing a
# periodic signal by sines and cosines. Once the coefficients are known, MTEX can evaluate,
# rotate, differentiate, and integrate the function efficiently.
#
# The preceding [Sampling](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunSampling_py.html) page used a bandwidth to state how much
# detail a discrete sample should preserve. Here we inspect that detail directly in an
# `S2FunHarmonic`.

# ## Construct a function from coefficients
#
# MTEX stores harmonic coefficients degree by degree in the `fhat` property. Degree zero
# contributes one coefficient. Degree one contributes the next three, ordered by harmonic
# order $-1$, 0, and 1. The vector below therefore sets $\hat f_0^0=1$, $\hat f_1^{-1}=0$,
# $\hat f_1^0=3$, and $\hat f_1^1=0$.

# ## Read the coefficient example
#
# This function has maximum harmonic degree 1. Its degree-zero coefficient supplies a
# constant part, while the nonzero degree-one coefficient makes the value change from one
# pole to the other. The smooth, broad variation is characteristic of a low-bandwidth
# function.
#
# ## What bandwidth controls
#
# The *bandwidth*, also called the harmonic cut-off degree, is the largest degree retained
# in the series. Smooth functions often need only a small bandwidth. Jumps, sharp edges, and
# narrow features require higher degrees. If the bandwidth is too small, truncation can blur
# those features and add oscillations around them.
#
# The next figure starts from a degree-256 representation of the smiley. It then retains
# degrees 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, and 8.

# ## Read the truncation sequence
#
# At degrees 256 and 128, the eyes and mouth have crisp boundaries. At degrees 64 and 32,
# the features broaden and oscillatory rings become visible. Degrees 16 and 8 no longer
# preserve the shape of the smile. This sequence turns bandwidth into a practical choice:
# lower it only until the feature or derived quantity of interest begins to change.
#
# ## Compute coefficients from a callable function
#
# Coefficients need not be entered by hand. Suppose a rule can evaluate $f(\mathbf{v})$ at
# arbitrary directions. A simple example is $f(\mathbf{v})=(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{x})^3$.
# The ninth power below uses the same construction but exposes more nonzero harmonic
# degrees.

# [S2FunHarmonic.quadrature](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunHarmonic.quadrature.html) evaluates this function on a
# weighted spherical grid and computes its coefficients. Without an explicit `bandwidth`
# option, it computes through the degree of the preference `defaultS2Bandwidth`.

# The value is positive around specimen X and negative around the opposite direction. It
# vanishes on the great circle perpendicular to X. Although the default representation
# stores many degrees, this polynomial needs no degree above 9.
#
# ## Inspect the harmonic spectrum
#
# [plotSpectrum](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunHarmonic.plotSpektra.html) groups coefficients by degree. At degree
# $m$, it plots $\left(\sum_{k=-m}^{m}|\hat f_m^k|^2\right)^{1/2}$.

# ## Read the spectrum
#
# Only odd degrees through 9 carry visible power. The earlier statement that almost all
# coefficients were zero except for the very first one was too strong: the ninth power
# contains contributions at degrees 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Coefficients beyond degree 9 are
# numerical quadrature noise.
#
# ## Remove negligible degrees
#
# [truncate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunHarmonic.truncate.html) removes trailing degrees whose coefficients are
# negligible relative to the spectrum. It does not refit the function. Here it reduces the
# stored bandwidth to 9.

# ## Read the truncated spectrum
#
# The same five nonzero odd degrees remain, while the empty high-degree tail has
# disappeared. For coefficients estimated from discrete noisy data, deciding where signal
# ends is a model choice rather than an exact polynomial test.
# [Spherical Approximation and Interpolation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunApproximationInterpolation_py.html) explains
# how MTEX estimates such coefficients from scattered values.
#
# ## See the first ten basis functions
#
# To conclude, the following command plots the first ten spherical harmonics. Each row of
# the identity matrix selects one basis function.

# Constant, dipolar, and progressively finer angular patterns appear as the coefficient
# index increases. These basis patterns are what the preceding examples add together.
#
# ## The maths behind the representation
#
# A function of bandwidth $M$ has the finite expansion
#
# $$ f(\mathbf{v}) = \sum_{m=0}^{M}\sum_{l=-m}^{m}
# \hat f_m^l Y_m^l(\mathbf{v}). $$
#
# Here $Y_m^l$ is the spherical harmonic of degree $m$ and order $l$.
# [Spherical Harmonics](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SphericalHarmonics_py.html) defines these basis functions. MTEX uses an
# orthonormal convention, so
#
# $$ \|Y_m^l\|_2=1 $$
#
# for every $m$ and $l$. Other normalizations occur in the literature, so coefficients from
# another package must use the same convention before they are assigned to `fhat`. The
# [Integration and norms](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunOperations_py.html) section defines the $L^2$ norm used here.
