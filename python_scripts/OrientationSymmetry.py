# # Symmetrically Equivalent Orientations
#
# A crystal cannot distinguish settings related by its point-group symmetry. One physical
# orientation therefore corresponds to a class of equivalent orthogonal transformations,
# not to one stored representative. MTEX carries that symmetry with the orientation and
# uses the whole class in symmetry-aware calculations.
#
# This page assumes that an orientation maps crystal coordinates into specimen
# coordinates, as developed in [Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DefinitionAsCoordinateTransform_py.html). It also
# assumes the point-group operations introduced in
# [Crystal Symmetries](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalSymmetries_py.html).
#
# A *symmetry* is the point group under which data are invariant. It is attached to a
# reference frame, but is not the frame itself. The crystal and specimen symmetries below
# are therefore attached to opposite sides of the orientation map.

# a generic orientation carrying both symmetries

# ## Which Side Acts
#
# Crystal symmetry acts on the input of the map, from the right. Specimen symmetry acts on
# its output, from the left. If `O` represents the stored orientation, every member of its
# class has the form
#
# $$ \mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{s}}\,\mathbf{O}\,\mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{c}}. $$
#
# The six crystal operations give the following representatives.

# equivalent orientations with respect to crystal symmetry
crystalEquivalents = ori * cs

# %% [markdown]
# Only the third Euler angle $\varphi_2$ changes, in steps of $60^\circ$. In the Bunge
# convention it is the rotation applied first, in crystal coordinates, which is where the
# crystal symmetry acts.
#
# Specimen symmetry produces the other kind of equivalence.

# %%
# equivalent orientations with respect to specimen symmetry
specimenEquivalents = ss * ori
specimenEquivalents

# %% [markdown]
# Now $\varphi_1$ changes because it is applied last, in specimen coordinates. Combining
# both sides gives $2 \times 6 = 12$ representatives.

# [symmetrise](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.symmetrise.html) is the shortcut for this product. It returns a
# new orientation array; it does not alter `ori`.

# ## Proper and Improper Operations
#
# Both groups in the first example contain only proper rotations. A full point group may
# also contain improper operations such as inversion or reflection. An orientation is a
# proper rotation, so only the proper half of a point group gives another setting of the
# crystal, and that is the half `symmetrise` lists. For cubic `m-3m` symmetry it returns
# the 24 rigid rotations out of the 48 orthogonal transformations of the group.

# %%
cubicOri = orientation.id(crystalFrame('m-3m'))

# %%
cubicCount = len(symmetrise(cubicOri))
cubicCount

# %% [markdown]
# The 24 improper operations remain symmetries of the lattice. They act wherever lattice
# or diffraction equivalence is the subject, which is a question about directions: a
# crystal direction reduces over the full group of its frame and carries `antipodal` for
# Friedel's law.

# %% [markdown]
# ## What This Looks Like in a Pole Figure
#
# One orientation and one crystal direction give a family of specimen directions. The
# `complete=True` flag keeps both hemispheres visible here so none of the twelve
# directions is folded into a smaller plotting region.

# %%
h = Miller(1, 0, 0, cs)

# %%
plotPF(ori, h, complete=True, markerSize=10, figSize='small')

# %% [markdown]
# Notice six poles in each hemisphere. The sixfold crystal symmetry creates the
# crystallographically equivalent direction family, and the twofold specimen symmetry
# repeats that family in the specimen frame. Without `complete=True`, `plotPF` exploits
# both antipodal equivalence and specimen symmetry and shows only the non-redundant part
# of this example.
#
# Which member a calculation produces depends on the stored representative.
# Symmetry-aware comparisons avoid making a physical result depend on that arbitrary
# choice.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Coincidences
#
# The product of the group sizes is the number of representatives before duplicates are
# removed. Some orientations make a left-side and a right-side operation describe the same
# transformation. At the identity orientation the crystal c axis and specimen z axis
# coincide, so the class has 12 entries but only 6 distinct ones. The `unique=True` option
# removes the duplicates.

# %%
identityOri = orientation.id(cs, ss)

# %%
coincidentCounts = [len(symmetrise(identityOri)), len(symmetrise(identityOri, unique=True))]

# ## Symmetry in Every Comparison
#
# Because the class is what matters, the angle between two orientations is the smallest
# rotational angle over their equivalent representatives. A fixed probe orientation
# therefore has the same symmetry-aware angle to every equivalent of the rotation returned
# by `orientation.goss`. The named rotation is used only as a reproducible reference here.

# %%
probe = orientation.byEuler(37 * degree, 48 * degree, 23 * degree, cs)
referenceEquivalents = symmetrise(orientation.goss(cs))

symmetryAwareAngles = angle(probe, referenceEquivalents) / degree

# %% [markdown]
# Switching symmetry off compares the stored rotations directly. It gives six different
# angles, whose minimum is the repeated value above.

# %%
rawAngles = angle(probe, referenceEquivalents, symmetry=False) / degree
rawAngles

# %% [markdown]
# The `symmetry=False` flag is implemented by [angle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.angle.html),
# [dot](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.dot.html), and [unique](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.unique.html), among other
# orientation methods. Reach for it when an angle or dot product comes out smaller than
# expected. Leave it alone otherwise, because the symmetry-aware answer is normally the
# physically meaningful one.
#
# Do not pass `symmetry=False` to [calcCluster](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.calcCluster.html). That
# method does not define the flag, and an unknown option can be ignored silently.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Technical Details
#
# `ori * cs` and `ss * ori` list the equivalents on one side, the group along a new axis,
# so `ss * ori * cs` is the full class shaped `(2, 6)`. The elements are the proper ones of
# each group, as `symmetrise` uses; an improper element would repeat an equivalent already
# in the list, an orientation being proper.
