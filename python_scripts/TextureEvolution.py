# # Texture Evolution
#
# Plastic deformation changes both the shape and the crystallographic texture of a
# polycrystal. Under the [Taylor model](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TaylorModel_py.html), each crystal accommodates the
# same imposed strain by slip and rotates as it does so. Repeating that rotation for
# small strain increments produces a simple simulation of texture evolution.
#
# [Import from VPSC](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VPSCImport_py.html) showed how to read a deformation history computed
# outside MTEX. Here the history is computed inside MTEX. The
# [Single Slip Model](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SingleSlipModel_py.html) instead solves the ODF continuity equation for
# independently slipping crystals.

# We use the {111}<110> slip systems of a face-centred cubic crystal.

# Plane strain is a simple model for rolling. The strain extends the first specimen axis,
# leaves the second unchanged, and shortens the third by the same amount. The parameter
# $q$ can distribute the shortening between the second and third axes; here $q=0$ gives
# plane strain.

q = 0
epsTotal = 0.6 * strainTensor(np.diag([1, -q, -(1 - q)]))

# ## Rotate one crystal
#
# A [spin tensor](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/RotationSpinTensor_py.html) describes an infinitesimal rotation. For one
# oriented crystal, `calcTaylor` returns the Taylor factor `M`, the slip amounts, and the
# crystallographic spin `W` required by the imposed strain increment. Slip systems live
# in the crystal frame. The inverse orientation therefore expresses the specimen strain
# in that frame before the Taylor solve.

# %%
oriSingle = orientation.byEuler(0, 30 * degree, 15 * degree, cs)
epsStep = 0.01 * strainTensor(np.diag([1, -q, -(1 - q)]))

M, _, W = calcTaylor(inv(oriSingle) * epsStep, sS)
print(M)
W

# Applying the negative crystallographic spin updates the orientation. The angle below
# measures the resulting orientation change.

# %%
oriNew = oriSingle.exp(-W)
rotationAngle = angle(oriSingle, oriNew) / degree

# One percent strain gives a Taylor factor of 2.3153 and rotates this crystal by 0.4975
# degrees. Spin depends on orientation, so crystals in a polycrystal follow different
# paths and this example develops texture.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Compute an orientation-dependent spin field
#
# Solving the Taylor problem separately at every sampled orientation would be slow. When
# the strain remains in the specimen frame, `calcTaylor` returns the Taylor factor and
# spin as [orientation-dependent functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3FunConcept_py.html). The expensive field can
# then be evaluated cheaply at an entire list of orientations.
#
# Divide the total strain into 60 increments and compute the corresponding spin field
# once. The Taylor solution is positively homogeneous in strain, so the same incremental
# field is used at every step.

# %%
numIter = 60
_, _, spin = calcTaylor(epsTotal / numIter, sS)

# This calculation takes most of the page's run time. Its cost depends on the bandwidth
# of the harmonic representation rather than on the later number of sampled
# orientations. Passing `bandwidth=16` is noticeably faster, at the price of a relative
# spin-field error of a few percent.

# ## Start from a uniform texture
#
# The 20,000 random orientations approximate a uniform texture, whose texture index
# $\lVert f\rVert^2$ is close to 1.

# ## Step through the strain history
#
# At every increment, evaluate the spin at the current orientations and move them by that
# rotation. The spin field returns tangent vectors at the orientations, which fixes the
# order and sign in `exp`. We retain the orientations after 20, 40, and 60 steps so their
# texture indices can be compared later.

# ## Read the resulting rolling texture
#
# The result lives in the rolling specimen frame. This frame names the axes rolling
# direction (RD), transverse direction (TD), and normal direction (ND). Its plotting
# convention places RD north, TD west, and ND out of the page.

# concentrated contours are the pole-figure signature of the fcc rolling components

# ## Measure texture strength
#
# The texture index is 1 for a uniform ODF and grows as orientation density becomes more
# concentrated. Compute it at 0, 20, 40, and 60 percent strain with the same
# density-estimation halfwidth, so the values are comparable.

# %% [markdown]
# The index rises from 1.0010 initially to 1.1499, 1.4984, and 1.9160. This steady
# increase quantifies the sharpening seen in the pole figures, although the ODF is not
# yet extremely concentrated at 60 percent strain.

# The same orientation-density maxima now appear in three phi2 sections. Their compact

# ## Numerical and physical limits
#
# * The step size matters. The spin field is computed for one increment and applied
#   `numIter` times. This is a first-order explicit update: too few steps give inaccurate
#   trajectories, while too many are needlessly slow.
# * The model deforms every crystal by exactly the same strain. This is the defining
#   Taylor assumption, and it overpredicts the sharpness of real textures because real
#   grains accommodate one another.
# * Nothing here depends on plane strain. Setting `epsTotal` to
#   `strainTensor(np.diag([-0.5, -0.5, 1]))` gives axisymmetric tension, and the same loop
#   produces the corresponding fibre texture.
# * The slip systems enter only through `sS`. Replacing `slipSystem.fcc` with
#   `slipSystem.bcc` or a hexagonal family changes the prediction.

# ## Technical Details
#
# The Taylor factor 2.3153 is unique, but the slip amounts that reach it are not: the
# optimal face of the linear program has many points. The port's simplex returns a vertex
# of that face and MATLAB's interior-point solver a point inside it, so the single crystal
# turns by 0.5320 degrees here where MATLAB reports 0.4975, and the spin field, which
# takes the minimum-norm point, is a third choice. The texture indices at 20, 40 and 60
# percent strain, 1.158, 1.490 and 1.847 for MATLAB's run 1.143, 1.482 and 1.892, differ
# by that and by the random start.
