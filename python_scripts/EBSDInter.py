# # Regridding and Interpolating EBSD Data
#
# An EBSD map stores one measurement at each acquired position.
# [Denoising](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDDenoising_py.html) changes noisy orientations without moving those
# positions. [Filling Missing Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDFilling_py.html) supplies values at missing
# positions while leaving the measurement grid unchanged.
#
# This page considers the other operation: reading the map at positions that were not
# measured, then sampling it on a different grid. MTEX uses nearest neighbours for this
# operation. It does not average orientations.
#
# The examples assume basic [EBSD selection](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDSelect_py.html) and the distinction
# between a list and a [gridded EBSD map](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDGrid_py.html).

# ## Reading the Map at One Point
#
# [interp](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.interp.html) evaluates a map at arbitrary coordinates. It works with a
# plain `EBSD` list, a phase subset, and a rotated or sheared map. The imported map in
# this example happens to be a square grid.

# %%
x = 30.5
y = 5.5

plot(ebsd, ebsd.orientations)
hold(True)
plt.plot(x, y, 'ko', markerfacecolor='w', markersize=7)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# The marker identifies the requested position. It lies between the centres of the
# coloured source pixels, so the result must be sampled from one of them.

# %%
e1 = interp(ebsd, x, y)
e1

# %% [markdown]
# The summary shows a new, one-entry `EBSD` variable at the requested position. MTEX
# finds the nearest source measurement and copies its phase, orientation, and per-pixel
# properties.
#
# The query is accepted only when the nearest measurement is no farther away than the
# furthest corner of `ebsd.unitCell`. This circular distance cutoff is not a
# polygon-containment test. A point beyond that reach returns as `notIndexed` instead of
# being extrapolated, whether it is outside the map or sufficiently far inside a hole.
#
# The `'xy'` selector also finds the nearest source measurement.

# %%
e2 = ebsd['xy', x, y]
e2

# %% [markdown]
# For this point, both commands therefore report the same orientation.

# %%
angle(e1.orientations, e2.orientations) / degree

# %% [markdown]
# The zero-degree result confirms the match. The two EBSD summaries expose the important
# difference: `e2` retains the source position and id, whereas `e1` sits at the requested
# position and receives a new id.
#
# With a list of query positions, `interp` returns one new entry per query in the same
# order. That behavior makes resampling possible; `'xy'` remains a selector for original
# measurements.

# ## Resampling onto a Different Grid
#
# A unit cell describes the shape and scale of a grid. [gridify](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD.gridify.html)
# derives its cell-to-cell translations, builds a lattice over the map extent, and reads
# the nearest measurement at the new positions. Here the unit cell is twice as large and
# rotated by 45 degrees.

# %%
# unit cell of twice the size, rotated by 45 degrees
uC = rotate(2 * ebsd.unitCell, 45 * degree)

# resample the map on the new lattice
ebsdNewGrid = gridify(ebsd, unitCell=uC)
ebsdNewGrid

# %% [markdown]
# ---

# %%
# plot only cells that received source data
plot(ebsdNewGrid['indexed'], ebsdNewGrid['indexed'].orientations)
ext = ebsd.extent()
plt.xlim(ext[0], ext[1])
plt.ylim(ext[2], ext[3])

# %% [markdown]
# Compare this figure with the first map. The orientation regions occupy the same
# specimen positions, but their pixels are now coarser and tilted. The orientations
# themselves have not been rotated. The specimen's grains also occupy the same physical
# regions; only their rasterized outlines have changed.
#
# The summary reports a 108 by 109 matrix. A tilted lattice needs a larger rectangular
# matrix to cover the source extent, so its corner cells project beyond the map. Fewer
# than half of the cells are indexed, which is why the plot excludes `notIndexed` cells.

# ## From a Hexagonal to a Square Grid
#
# A custom unit cell can also change the grid type. The ferrite data was measured on a
# hexagonal grid.

# %%

ebsd = mtexdata('ferrite')

plot(ebsd[0:50, 0:100], ebsd[0:50, 0:100].orientations)

# %% [markdown]
# The staggered pixel rows reveal the hexagonal sampling lattice. Their orientations are
# measurements; the next figure only redraws those values on a different lattice.
#
# A square cell with half the measurement spacing gives a drawing grid fine enough to
# distinguish neighbouring source positions in this example. This smaller cell does not
# improve the map's spatial resolution.

# %%
# define a square unit cell
squnitCell = ebsd.dPos / 4 * vector3d([-1, -1, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 1, -1], 0)

# resample on the square lattice
ebsdS = ebsd.gridify(unitCell=squnitCell)

squareGridSize = ebsdS.shape
squareGridSize

# %%
plot(ebsdS[0:150, 0:350], ebsdS[0:150, 0:350].orientations)

# %% [markdown]
# The result is a square grid with 808 by 809 cells in place of the 270 by 234 hexagonal
# cells, about ten times as many. The stepped colour regions show that each new cell
# repeats its nearest hexagonal measurement. No orientation was invented on the way.

# %% [markdown]
# ## What Regridding Does Not Change
#
# Resampling changes the array size and pixel outlines, not the acquisition step or the
# spatial resolution of the experiment. Repeated cells are not independent measurements.
# Keep the original map for quantitative counts, orientation statistics, and grain-size
# measurements unless the analysis explicitly requires a new raster.
#
# Every copied quality value still describes the original diffraction pattern. It is not
# evidence that a pattern was acquired at the new cell. Use
# [Filling Missing Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDFilling_py.html) to recover orientations at missing positions,
# or [Denoising](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDDenoising_py.html) to reduce orientation noise. Neither task is
# performed by `interp`.
