# # Parent and Child Variants
#
# The stable crystallographic structure of most materials depends on conditions such as
# temperature and pressure. A solid-state phase transition changes that structure when the
# conditions change.
#
# The initial lattice is the *parent phase*, and the resulting lattice is the *child phase*.
#
# The two phases can have the same chemical composition but different crystal structures. In
# titanium, the parent beta phase is cubic and the child alpha phase is hexagonal.

# ## The Burgers orientation relationship
#
# An *orientation relationship* (OR) is a fixed angular relation between the parent and
# child lattices. Atomic rearrangement during the transition makes some plane and direction
# alignments energetically favourable.
#
# Let `oriParent` describe the lattice before the transition.

# %%
oriParent = orientation.rand(csBeta)

# %% [markdown]
# The dominant OR between beta and alpha titanium is the Burgers OR. MTEX stores it as a
# parent-to-child [orientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.orientation.html).

# %%
beta2alpha = orientation.Burgers(csBeta, csAlpha)
beta2alpha

# %% [markdown]
# A child orientation consistent with this OR is obtained by multiplying the parent
# orientation by the inverse OR.

# %%
oriChild = oriParent * inv(beta2alpha)
oriChild

# %% [markdown]
# The Burgers OR aligns a hexagonal $(0001)$ plane with a cubic $(110)$ plane. It also aligns
# a hexagonal $[2\bar{1}\bar{1}0]$ direction with a cubic $[\bar{1}1\bar{1}]$ direction.
#
# The two pole figures below check those parallelisms for `oriParent` and `oriChild`.
#
# In the left panel all twelve small child poles fall on a large parent pole. The plane
# alignment survives every symmetric copy. The right panel is different: only four of the
# twelve child directions land on a parent pole, and the rest sit 10.5 or 49.5 degrees away.
# The six equivalent basal directions are 60 degrees apart, while the two cubic axes lying in
# the same plane are 70.5 degrees apart, so a direction alignment cannot repeat for every
# copy the way a plane alignment does.

#
# The same alignment rules can define the OR directly with
# [`orientation.map`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.map.html).

# Defining the OR through crystal planes and directions has an important advantage. The
# definition does not depend on the [hexagonal crystal-frame convention](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalReferenceSystem_py.html).
#
# ## Child variants
#
# A *variant* is one crystallographically equivalent child orientation predicted from a
# single parent orientation by a known OR. It is the finest-grained classification of a child
# relative to its parent.
#
# Cubic proper symmetry gives `oriParent` 24 equivalent representations.

# %%
oriParentSym = oriParent.symmetrise()
oriParentSym.size

# %% [markdown]
# Applying the OR to all 24 representations gives 24 child orientations.

# %%
oriChild = oriParentSym * inv(beta2alpha)
oriChild.size

# %% [markdown]
# Under hexagonal child symmetry, some of these orientations represent the same physical
# orientation. For the exact Burgers OR they form 12 pairs.
#
# The inverse pole figure places both members of each pair at the same location. The 24
# computations therefore appear as only 12 distinct points.

# %%
plotIPF(oriChild, vector3d.Z)

# %% [markdown]
# [`variants`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.variants.html) removes the symmetry-equivalent duplicates
# directly. It returns the 12 child variants for this OR.

# %%
oriChild = variants(beta2alpha, oriParent)

for i in range(1, 13):
  plotIPF(oriChild[i - 1], ind2color(i), vector3d.Z, label=i, markerEdgeColor='k')

# %% [markdown]
# The labels are variant IDs. A variant ID is an index into this ordered set, so specific
# variants can be selected by passing their IDs.

# %%
oriChild = variants(beta2alpha, oriParent, [2, 3])

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exact and approximate orientation relationships
#
# The reduction from 24 parent representations to 12 variants is specific to the exact
# Burgers OR. A general OR between these two phases has exactly 24 variants.
#
# Disturbing the Burgers OR by a fixed 2 degree rotation breaks the exact pairing.

# %%
beta2alpha = beta2alpha * orientation.byAxisAngle(vector3d(1, 2, 3), 2 * degree, csBeta, csBeta)

# %% [markdown]
# The inverse pole figure now contains 24 points. They remain close to the 12 exact Burgers
# positions, so each former pair appears slightly split. `variants` treats two
# representations as the same when they agree to within about 1.6 degrees, which is why the
# perturbation has to exceed that for the pairs to separate.

# %%
oriChildPerturbed = variants(beta2alpha, oriParent)
print(oriChildPerturbed.size)
plotIPF(oriChildPerturbed, vector3d.Z)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Identify an observed variant
#
# The inverse task is to determine a variant ID from a parent-child pair or from two child
# orientations. The [`calcVariants`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/parentGrainReconstructor.calcVariants.html) method does
# this after a parent grain reconstruction has been computed.
#
# That workflow is demonstrated in [Parent Austenite Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MaParentGrainReconstruction_py.html).
#
# ## Parent variants
#
# The same ambiguity occurs in the opposite direction. Given one child orientation, several
# parent orientations could have produced it. [`variants`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.variants.html)
# returns them with `'parent'`.

# %%
# return to the exact Burgers orientation relationship
b2a = orientation.Burgers(csBeta, csAlpha)

# select one child variant
oriChildSingle = variants(b2a, oriParent, 1)

oriParents = variants(b2a, oriChildSingle, 'parent')
oriParents.size

# %% [markdown]
# There are six parent variants, compared with 12 child variants. The two counts need not
# agree because the parent and child point-group orders govern them differently.
#
# One of the six is the parent orientation from which the child was made. The minimum
# misorientation below is therefore zero degrees to numerical precision.

# %%
np.min(angle(oriParents, oriParent)) / degree

# %% [markdown]
# The [`parents`](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/orientation.parents.html) method returns the same set of OR variants.
# Multiplying the child orientation by them produces the six candidate parent orientations.

# %%
unique(oriChildSingle * b2a.parents())

# %% [markdown]
# A single child orientation cannot identify which candidate parent is correct. Parent grain
# reconstruction resolves the ambiguity by comparing neighbouring child grains.
