# # Three-Dimensional Grains
#
# In EBSD grain segmentation, a grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region
# of pixels produced by segmentation. In three dimensions, MTEX represents its counterpart
# by the faces of a closed polyhedron and stores a collection as a `grain3d` object. The
# faces provide the geometry; phase and mean orientation describe the material inside each
# polyhedron.
#
# This page follows one collection from import through selection, sectioning, and
# inspection of its boundary normals. The following pages explain the
# [Neper workflow](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/NeperInterface_py.html), [geometric properties](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DProperties_py.html),
# and [operations on three-dimensional grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DOperations_py.html) in detail.

# ## Import a DREAM.3D surface mesh
#
# `grain3d.load` reads a DREAM.3D triangle mesh into a `grain3d` collection. The voxel
# data of the same file is read by `EBSD3.load` and segmented by `calcGrains`, see
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DReconstruction_py.html).

# %%
fname = mtexdatafile('SmallIN100')
grains = grain3d.load(fname)
print(grains)

# ## Read the imported microstructure
#
# The summary reports the phases, number of grains, total volume and boundary faces.
# Plotting the mean orientation assigns one orientation colour to each polyhedron; it does
# not display pointwise orientation variation.

# %%

setCamera(how2plot)

# %% [markdown]
# The colour changes sharply at grain contacts. Faint triangle edges reveal the surface
# mesh while keeping the grain shapes and colours readable. Use `edgeAlpha` between 0.1
# and 0.2 for this balance.
#
# The figure links to an interactive view of the same scene: drag to rotate it, scroll to
# zoom.

# ## Why face winding matters
#
# A face normal is perpendicular to one boundary face. Its sign follows from the order of
# the face vertices, called the face winding. DREAM.3D stores faces with arbitrary
# winding, so the stored normal may point into or out of a grain.
#
# By default, the importer calls `orientFaces`. MTEX then uses `I_GF` to record which
# direction is outward for each grain. This makes signed volumes and `boundary.grainId`
# directly usable. Request the raw DREAM.3D winding only when that order is itself needed.

# %%
grainsRaw = grain3d.load(fname, orientFaces=False)

# %% [markdown]
# The first value below counts negative raw volumes; the second checks the oriented import.
# Negative values diagnose inconsistent orientation of the enclosing faces; they are not
# negative amounts of material.

# %%
print([np.count_nonzero(grainsRaw.volume < 0), np.count_nonzero(grains.volume < 0)])

# ## Select a grain
#
# A collection can be indexed by any logical condition. The following code finds the
# array position of the largest grain and then plots that grain. Grain ids and array
# positions can differ after subsetting, so use an id query when the persistent identity
# matters.

# %%
id = int(np.argmax(grains.volume))
print(id)

plot(grains[id], edgeAlpha=0.2, micronbar='off')
setCamera(how2plot)

# %% [markdown]
# The translucent edges expose the triangular boundary mesh of the selected polyhedron.
# The result is one three-dimensional grain, not a planar section.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Cut a planar section
#
# A `plane3d` is defined by a normal direction and a point in the plane. `slice`
# intersects that plane with every grain and returns the resulting polygons as a `grain2d`
# collection, comparable to what can be reconstructed from a two-dimensional EBSD map.

# %%
plane = plane3d(vector3d(1, 1, 1), vector3d(-20, 20, -15))
grains2 = grains.slice(plane)
print(grains2)

plot(grains2, grains2.meanOrientation, micronbar='off')
setCamera(how2plot)

# %% [markdown]
# The plot contains only grains crossed by the plane. Each polygon inherits the mean
# orientation of its parent three-dimensional grain.
#
# For a face-on view, use a plotting convention whose out-of-screen direction is the
# section normal. The east direction fixes the remaining in-plane freedom.

# %%
how2plot2 = plottingConvention()
how2plot2.outOfScreen = grains2.N
how2plot2.east = vector3d(1, -1, 0)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Look inside the volume
#
# The outer surface hides the neighbourhood of an interior grain. Selecting a few grains
# exposes the shapes that matter for local constraint and load transfer. The boundary
# stores persistent grain ids, so selection remains valid even when the collection has
# been sorted or reduced.

# %%

# The opaque grain and its translucent neighbours share actual boundary faces. Proximity
# of their centroids alone would not establish that they touch.
# [Boundary Network](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DBoundaries_py.html) measures those contacts and the junctions
# between them.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Plot outward normals for one grain
#
# A shared face has only one stored normal, so that normal cannot point outwards from
# both adjacent grains. The corresponding row of `I_GF` contains the sign needed for the
# selected grain. Multiplying by that sign produces outward directions.

# %%
# select by array position; the boundary keeps the persistent grain ids

# Continue with [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Grains3DReconstruction_py.html) to build these

# ## Technical details
#
# Positions count from 0: MATLAB's grain `id = 3` is `grains[2]` here, and the largest
# grain's position is one less than MATLAB prints. `slice(grains, plane)` is the method
# `grains.slice(plane)`, since `slice` is a Python builtin. MATLAB's `axis off` and empty
# labels after `setCamera` have nothing to act on in a 3D scene.
