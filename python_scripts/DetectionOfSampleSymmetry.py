# # Aligning Orthotropic Specimen Symmetry
#
# A rolled sheet is often modelled with orthotropic [specimen symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SpecimenSymmetry_py.html).
# Its texture is unchanged by a $180^\circ$ rotation about the rolling direction (RD),
# transverse direction (TD), or normal direction (ND). The MTEX expression
# `specimenFrame('222')` represents these three twofold rotations.
#
# The symmetry is easy to recognize only when its axes agree with the
# [specimen frame](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/AxesAlignment_py.html). In conventional antipodal
# [pole figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFPoleFigure_py.html), orthotropic symmetry then appears as mirror symmetry
# about the horizontal and vertical specimen axes. A slightly tilted mounting moves the
# symmetry axes without removing the symmetry of the material.
#
# [centerSpecimen](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.centerSpecimen.html) searches an
# [orientation distribution function](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html) (ODF) for two perpendicular twofold
# axes. It then rotates those axes onto the nearest specimen axes. The method aligns an
# assumed orthotropic texture; it does not prove that the specimen has orthotropic
# symmetry. Always compare the fitted axes and corrected pole figures with the specimen
# geometry.

# ## A Synthetic Known-Answer Example
#
# Start from an ODF that is exactly orthotropic. The rolling frame names its axes RD, TD,
# and ND and supplies the corresponding plotting convention.

# %%
specimenFrame.rolling.makeDefault()
plottingConvention.default('y←↑x')
CS = crystalFrame('cubic')
SS = specimenFrame('222')

# component centres
ori = cat(orientation.byEuler(135 * degree, 45 * degree, 120 * degree, CS, SS),
          orientation.byEuler(60 * degree, 54.73 * degree, 45 * degree, CS, SS),
          orientation.byEuler(70 * degree, 90 * degree, 45 * degree, CS, SS),
          orientation.byEuler(0 * degree, 0 * degree, 0 * degree, CS, SS))

# corresponding volume fractions
c = [0.4, 0.13, 0.4, 0.07]

# build the model ODF
odf = unimodalODF(ori, weights=c, halfwidth=12 * degree)

# plot three pole figures
h = cat(Miller(1, 1, 1, CS), Miller(2, 0, 0, CS), Miller(2, 2, 0, CS))
plotPF(odf, h, antipodal=True, verbose=False, complete=True, upper=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Each pole figure is symmetric about its horizontal and vertical axes. This is the
# pole-figure signature of the modelled orthotropic symmetry.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Simulate a Mounting Error
#
# The known rotation below simulates a specimen mounted askew. Draw 1000 orientations
# from the model, apply the mounting rotation, and reconstruct an ODF by
# [density estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html).
#
# The sampled orientations inherit `222` specimen symmetry from the model. The `stripSym`
# method removes that group while keeping the rolling frame. The simulated observations
# then retain their physical RD, TD, and ND labels without claiming symmetry about the
# nominal plot axes.

# %%
# define the mounting rotation
rot = rotation.byEuler(15 * degree, 12 * degree, -5 * degree)

# sample without imposing symmetry, then rotate the observed texture
ori = discreteSample(odf, 1000)
ori.SS = stripSym(ori.SS)
ori = rot * ori

# estimate an ODF from the sampled orientations
odfEst = calcDensity(ori, halfwidth=10 * degree)

# plot the tilted estimate
plotPF(odfEst, h, antipodal=True, verbose=False)

# %% [markdown]
# The lobes no longer pair across the displayed horizontal and vertical axes. They still
# form nearly symmetric pairs about tilted axes. Sampling and smoothing make those pairs
# approximate rather than exact.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Recover the Alignment
#
# With no second argument, `centerSpecimen` starts its search near the $x$ axis. The
# function reports a fit while locating each twofold axis. These values diagnose the
# optimization objective; they are not confidence levels or evidence that the orthotropic
# model is physically correct.
#
# The returned rotation is the correction applied to the input ODF. Its inverse should
# therefore recover the known mounting rotation.

# %%
odfCorrected, rotCorrection = centerSpecimen(odfEst)[:2]

plotPF(odfCorrected, h, antipodal=True, verbose=False)

recoveryError = angle(rot, inv(rotCorrection)) / degree
print(f'difference between applied and recovered rotation: {recoveryError:.3f} degree')

# %% [markdown]
# The horizontal and vertical mirror relationships have returned without imposing
# specimen symmetry on the reconstructed ODF. The printed difference is about one degree.
# It is not zero because the estimate uses a finite sample of 1000 orientations and a
# smoothing kernel.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Apply the Method to Measured Pole Figures
#
# The same method applies to an ODF reconstructed from measured pole figures. Load the
# Aachen data and inspect the measurements before reconstruction.

# %%
fname = mtexdatafile('aachenexp')
pf = PoleFigure.load(fname)

plot(pf, verbose=False)

# %% [markdown]
# The measured pole figures already suggest horizontal and vertical symmetry, but their
# strongest features are slightly displaced from those axes. This visual impression
# motivates an alignment; it is not by itself proof of orthotropic symmetry.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reconstruct and Locate the Symmetry Axes
#
# Reconstruct the ODF as described in [Reconstructing an ODF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigure2ODF_py.html). The
# plot uses the same three pole families as the synthetic example.

# %%
odfMeasured = calcODF(pf, verbose=False)

plotPF(odfMeasured, h, antipodal=True, verbose=False, axisLabels=False, grid='on')

# %% [markdown]
# The density maxima nearly reflect across the nominal specimen axes, with a small common
# tilt. The common displacement is the pattern that `centerSpecimen` can quantify.
#
# The second argument below starts the first-axis search near $y$, the nominal TD. The
# `'Fourier'` flag evaluates the symmetry mismatch from a harmonic representation. The
# third and fourth outputs are the twofold axes found in the uncorrected ODF.

# %%
_, rotCorrection, a1, a2 = centerSpecimen(odfMeasured, vector3d.Y, 'Fourier')

# orient the unoriented twofold axes towards the nominal RD, TD, and ND
rdAxis = -a2
tdAxis = a1
ndAxis = cross(rdAxis, tdAxis)

print(f'mounting correction: {angle(rotCorrection) / degree:.3f} degree')
print(f'axis offsets from nominal RD, TD, ND: {angle(rdAxis, vector3d.X, antipodal=True) / degree:.3f}, '
      f'{angle(tdAxis, vector3d.Y, antipodal=True) / degree:.3f}, {angle(ndAxis, vector3d.Z, antipodal=True) / degree:.3f} degree')

annotate(cat(rdAxis, tdAxis, ndAxis), label=['RD', 'TD', 'ND'], backgroundColor='w', markerSize=8)

# %% [markdown]
# The annotations show the fitted RD, TD, and ND on the uncorrected pole figures. The
# fitted RD and TD share a small in-plane offset, while ND remains close to its nominal
# direction. The correction is $2.871^\circ$. The RD, TD, and ND offsets are
# $2.865^\circ$, $2.871^\circ$, and $0.187^\circ$. The signs of twofold axes are
# equivalent; they were chosen above only to place each label near its nominal positive
# direction.
#
# Correct the alignment before assigning a nontrivial
# [specimen symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SpecimenSymmetry_py.html). Imposing orthotropic symmetry first would
# average the texture over the wrong axes and could hide the mounting error.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Limits of Symmetry-Based Alignment
#
# The method assumes that the ODF contains a strong enough orthotropic pattern to locate
# two perpendicular axes. Weak textures, genuine departures from orthotropic symmetry,
# multiple local optima, and a poor starting direction can make the fitted axes
# unreliable. The kernel halfwidth used for density estimation can also change the
# result. A smaller halfwidth does not necessarily improve the alignment.
#
# Treat the correction as a model fit. Check several pole families, compare the axes with
# the specimen geometry, and repeat the search from another starting direction when the
# result is surprising. Do not use alignment to turn a genuinely asymmetric texture into
# an orthotropic one.

# ## Technical Details
#
# `centerSpecimen` returns its four outputs, the corrected function, the correction, and
# the two twofold axes found, whatever the call asks for; the `'Fourier'` flag names the
# harmonic search the port always runs, and the search prints nothing. The random sample
# differs from MATLAB's draw, so the recovered rotation differs from its $0.820^\circ$
# in the digits.
