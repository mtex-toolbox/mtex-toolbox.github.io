# # Spherical Density Estimation
#
# A long list of measured directions is often easier to interpret as a smooth density on
# the sphere. High values identify directions that occur more often than they would in a
# uniform population.
#
# This page applies kernel density estimation to `vector3d` data. It assumes the vector
# construction from [Defining Three-Dimensional Vectors](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorDefinition_py.html), the
# direction-axis distinction from [Axes and Antipodal Symmetry](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorsAxes_py.html), and the
# plots introduced in [Spherical Projections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SphericalProjections_py.html). The general
# statistical idea is developed in [Density Estimation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/DensityEstimation_py.html).

# The calculation uses 152345 axes. One `vector3d` variable holds the entire list, which
# is why the object summary itself is suppressed above.
#
# A crystallographic c-axis is an unoriented line: `c` and `-c` represent the same
# physical axis. The `antipodal` flag records that assumption.

# %%
cAxes.antipodal = True

# The projected sphere is almost covered by markers. Some concentrations are visible, but
# their relative strengths cannot be read from this overlap.
#
# [calcDensity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.calcDensity.html) replaces the point cloud by a continuous
# spherical function. Given no halfwidth, it selects one from the data, which assumes
# independent observations; the pixel axes of a map are not, as the section *Letting the
# Data Choose the Halfwidth* shows. So this page names MATLAB's default, 10 degrees.

# At 2.5 degrees the estimate contains many narrow peaks. At 20 degrees those peaks have
# merged into broad regions. A small halfwidth can preserve measurement-scale variation,

# accurate.
#
# The halfwidth also sets the harmonic bandwidth needed to represent the kernel. Print
# both the peak density and bandwidth for the four estimates.

# %% [markdown]
# Across this sweep the maximum falls from 14 to 2.5 m.u.d., while the bandwidth falls
# from 92 to 13. A sharper estimate is more expensive as well as more sensitive to
# fine-scale variation.
#
# The relevant sample size is the number of independent observations, not merely the
# number of pixels. Neighbouring EBSD pixels are spatially correlated because many sample
# the same grain. `calcKernel` selects a halfwidth from the data with the grains taken
# into account; the section *Letting the Data Choose the Halfwidth* below applies it once
# the grains are reconstructed. For orientation data,
# [ODF Estimation from EBSD Data](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSD2ODF_py.html) explains this dependence and
# [Optimal Kernel Selection](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OptimalKernel_py.html) describes the selection methods.

# ## Weighting Changes the Question
#
# A grain is a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels produced by
# segmentation. Reconstruct the indexed map with an example 10 degree misorientation
# threshold, then keep the Forsterite grains.

# %% [markdown]
# The reconstruction gives 1151 Forsterite grain axes instead of 152345 pixel axes.
# Giving each grain one vote describes the distribution of grains. Weighting by sectional
# grain area describes the mapped material area, which is the question answered by equal
# pixel weights on this regular scan.

# %% [markdown]
# With a common colour range, equal grain weights give the flattest panel. Area weighting
# restores the main concentrations of the pixel estimate, although replacing every grain
# by its mean orientation removes the within-grain spread. The scientifically correct
# weights depend on whether the population of interest is grains, mapped area, or
# something else.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Letting the Data Choose the Halfwidth
#
# `calcKernel` selects the kernel from the axes themselves; `calcDensity` calls it whenever
# no halfwidth is given. Its default method `'UCV'` estimates the integrated squared error
# of the density for every candidate halfwidth and takes the halfwidth where the estimate
# is least, but never one so narrow that noise could raise bumps above a fifth of the
# estimate's maximum. `'conservative'` takes a halfwidth at least as wide as the optimum
# with high probability.
# [Optimal Kernel Selection](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OptimalKernel_py.html) explains both.
#
# Both rules take the observations as independent unless told otherwise. Pixel axes are
# not, and directions do not carry that knowledge, so pass the grain id of every pixel.
# `calcGrains` left the ids on `ebsdIndexed`, in the order of the Forsterite pixels of
# `cAxes`.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# Taken as independent, the 152345 pixel axes drive the selection to the narrowest
# candidate, 1 degree: neighbouring pixels repeat one axis, and the rule reads the
# repetition as a sharp density. Even the noise floor cannot help, since with that many
# observations it expects hardly any noise. With the grain ids it asks for 21 degrees,
# close to the 20 degrees of the grain axes weighted by their area, which describe the same
# mapped area.
#
# One vote per grain asks for 2.5 degrees, the narrowest kernel the noise floor admits for
# 1151 axes. Of the 1151 grains 531 are single pixels, mostly fragments beside a grain of
# nearly the same orientation, so the grain axes repeat each other as well: 1675 pairs of
# them lie within 1 degree, several times what independent axes would give. The area
# weight gives those fragments almost no say.
#
# The conservative rule on the pixels with their grain ids:

# %%
psiConservative = calcKernel(cAxes, 'conservative', groups=pixelGrainId, rng=rng)
psiConservative.halfwidth() / degree

# %% [markdown]
# It asks for 24 degrees, a little wider than UCV's 21, as it should: it takes the energies
# of the axis distribution at their lower confidence bounds. Weighted by area, the few
# large grains dominate the map, which leaves these bounds loose. A reported halfwidth is
# worth checking against the plots of the previous section rather than taken on trust.

# ## Working with the Density Function
#
# A density is an [S2Fun](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunConcept_py.html), so it can be evaluated, integrated,
# searched for peaks, combined with other spherical functions, and sampled.
# [Operations on Spherical Functions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2FunOperations_py.html) develops that common
# interface.
#
# First find the global maximum.

# The output gives both the density and the specimen direction where it is attained. The
# `numLocal` option requests several distinct local maxima.

# %% [markdown]
# The first local maximum is the global one. Integrate the density within 20 degrees of
# that axis using [volume](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2Fun.volume.html).

# %%
smoothedFraction = volume(pdf, localPos[0], 20 * degree)
smoothedFraction

# %% [markdown]
# The smoothed estimate assigns 0.1723, or 17.23 percent, of the population to that axial
# neighbourhood. Count the original axes in the same region.

# %%
observedFraction = np.mean(angle(cAxes, localPos[0]) < 20 * degree)
observedFraction

# %% [markdown]
# The direct count is 0.1890, or 18.90 percent. Smoothing moves some density across the
# boundary of the 20 degree neighbourhood, so the two questions do not have to give the
# same answer.
#
# Evaluate the density at the three specimen basis directions.

# %%
basisDensities = pdf.eval(cat(vector3d.X, vector3d.Y, vector3d.Z))
basisDensities

# %% [markdown]
# Among X, Y and Z, the Y direction has the largest density in this example. If only these
# values are needed, pass the evaluation directions directly:
#
#     f = calcDensity(cAxes, cat(vector3d.X, vector3d.Y, vector3d.Z))
#
# A random sample from the estimate can replace the large point cloud in a simulation or
# exploratory plot.

# ## Crystal Directions and Symmetry
#
# The previous density lives in the specimen reference frame. An inverse pole density
# instead fixes a specimen direction and asks which crystal directions are parallel to
# it. Express specimen Z in the crystal frame of every Forsterite orientation.

# %%
h = inv(ebsd['Fo'].orientations) * vector3d.Z

# %% [markdown]
# The result is a list of crystal directions carrying the Forsterite crystal symmetry.
# [calcDensity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.calcDensity.html) transfers that symmetry to the density
# automatically.

# The coloured sector contains the complete inverse pole density without repeating

# ## Choosing a Different Kernel
#
# The default is the non-negative
# [de la Vallee Poussin kernel](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2DeLaValleePoussinKernel.html). Its finite harmonic
# expansion avoids truncation ringing. The `kernel` option also accepts other
# [spherical kernels](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2Kernels_py.html).
#
# Compare the default 10 degree kernel with a [Dirichlet kernel](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2DirichletKernel.html)
# truncated at bandwidth 12.

minimumDirichletDensity = min(pdf2)[0]
minimumDirichletDensity

# %% [markdown]
# The minimum is -0.4029, which is not a valid probability density. Non-negative kernels
# are therefore the appropriate default for density estimation. A Dirichlet kernel
# remains useful for operations where exact harmonic truncation, rather than
# non-negativity, is the objective.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Density Estimation While Plotting
#
# Smooth plotting options for a large `vector3d` list perform density estimation
# internally. The `contourf`, `smooth` and `pcolor` modes use a 5 degree halfwidth when
# none is supplied.

# %%
plot(cAxes, contourf=True, upper=True)

mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# This 5 degree plot is sharper than the explicit 10 degree estimate `pdf`. Use
# [calcDensity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/vector3d.calcDensity.html) explicitly when the density itself, its
# weights, its kernel, or a reproducible smoothing choice matters.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Maths Behind the Estimate
#
# Let $v_n$ be unit directions with non-negative weights $w_n$, and let $\psi$ be a
# normalized radial kernel. MTEX computes the weighted kernel estimate
#
# $$f(v) = \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^{N}w_n} \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n\,\psi(v\mathbin{\cdot}v_n).$$
#
# Equal weights reduce the denominator to $N$. For axial input, the result is symmetrized
# so that $f(v)=f(-v)$. The normalization makes the mean of $f$ equal to one under MTEX's
# uniform spherical measure.
#
# The estimate is a model of an unknown population density, not the unknown density
# itself. Decreasing the halfwidth reduces smoothing bias but raises sampling variation;
# increasing it does the reverse.
