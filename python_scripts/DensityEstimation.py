# # Density Estimation
#
# Density estimation turns a finite sample into a continuous function. In texture analysis,
# the samples may be EBSD orientations, grain mean orientations, misorientation axes, or
# simulated orientations.
#
# Keep three parts of the calculation distinct:
#
# * **input:** samples $x_n$, possibly with statistical weights;
# * **assumption:** nearby samples belong to a smoothly varying density;
# * **result:** an estimate $f_N$ of an unknown density $f$.
#
# Pole-figure intensities are different input. They are sampled values of a projected pole
# density rather than random orientations. Recovering an ODF from them is an inverse problem,
# not the kernel estimate described here.
#
# The worked sequence starts with real numbers. It then applies the same construction to
# directions and orientations.

# two; the draw here is another one, so its modes sit elsewhere.
#
# The bandwidth is estimated from the same twenty samples, and twenty samples do not locate
# the broad component of the mixture. Read the estimate as one draw rather than as the density
# itself.

# For one-dimensional data, the `bandwidth` option fixes the smoothing parameter instead.

# The estimate is positive everywhere, but most of the square carries very little of it. The
# `LaboTeX` colour map starts at white, and most of the grid falls in the lowest contour band,
# so the field reads as a few pink islands on a white ground.

# White here means density below the first contour, not zero. The islands sit at the four
# combinations of the two one-dimensional modes. The pair of narrow modes near $x = 0.2$,
# $y = 0.2$ is by far the densest, and the pair of broad modes near $x = 0.5$, $y = 0.5$ is the
# faintest.

# ## Directions need kernels on the sphere
#
# A directional kernel uses angular distance on the sphere rather than ordinary distance on a

# one phase boundary population. A misorientation axis is the direction about which one
# crystal must be rotated to match the other.

# ## Weights decide what population the density describes
#
# A weighted sample gives some observations more mass than others. Grain orientations make
# the physical choice clear. Equal weights answer "what fraction of grains has this
# orientation?" Pixel-count weights approximate "what fraction of the mapped area has this
# orientation?"

# %% [markdown]
# The unequal peaks, 7.6274 and 8.9863 mrd in MATLAB, show that weighting changes the
# estimated population, not just the plotting style. On a regular map, pixel count is
# proportional to mapped area. State the sampling unit before interpreting an ODF.
#
# ## Parametric estimation answers a different question
#
# Kernel estimation assumes smoothness but does not prescribe one global shape. *Parametric
# density estimation* instead assumes that the unknown density belongs to a chosen family and
# estimates that family's parameters.
#
# For a Gaussian, those parameters are the mean and standard deviation. The analogous models
# on spheres and in orientation space are Bingham distributions. See
# [Spherical Bingham Distribution](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S2Bingham_py.html) and [Bingham ODFs](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BinghamODFs_py.html) for
# fitting and checking those models.
#
# ## The maths behind kernel density estimation
#
# For equally weighted samples $x_1,\ldots,x_N$ and a normalized kernel $\psi$, the estimate
# is
#
# $$ f_N(x) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \psi(x-x_n). $$
#
# Each observation contributes the same total mass. The kernel decides how far that mass
# spreads. For non-negative weights $w_n$, MTEX replaces the equal average by a normalized
# weighted sum.
#
# On the rotation group, let $o_n$ be orientations and let $\psi$ be a radially symmetric
# kernel. The weighted ODF estimate is
#
# $$ f(o) = \frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_j} \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \psi(o o_n^{-1}). $$
#
# MTEX also accounts for the symmetry-equivalent representatives carried by each
# orientation. Different phases generally have different crystal symmetries, so estimate an
# EBSD-derived ODF from one selected phase at a time. [Kernels on SO(3)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Kernels_py.html)
# compares the kernel families.
