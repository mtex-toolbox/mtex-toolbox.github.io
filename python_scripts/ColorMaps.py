# # Color Mapping
#
# A colour range is the numerical interval represented by a plot's colours.
# Its lower and upper limits receive the end colours of the colormap. Two
# plots can be compared by colour only when they use the same range and the
# same colormap.
#
# This page shows how MTEX chooses the range, how to fix it, and how a
# colormap translates values within that range into colours. Legends for
# discrete objects and colour keys for directions were distinguished on
# [Legends](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/Legends_py.html).

# ## Create two quantities to compare
#
# An [orientation distribution function (ODF)](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFAnalysis.html) describes
# the relative frequency of crystal orientations. This model ODF supplies
# two simulated [pole figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/PoleFigureAnalysis.html) whose densities can
# be compared.

odf = fibreODF(Miller(1, 1, 0, cs), zvector)

# ## The default range is tight and per axis
#
# Without a `colorRange` option, MTEX uses `'tight'`. Each axis spans the
# range of its own data. This uses the available colours fully, but it does
# not guarantee that colours are comparable between axes.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# Read the two colour bars before comparing the patterns. The $(100)$ panel
# reaches approximately 3.5 multiples of a uniform distribution (mrd),
# whereas the $(111)$ panel reaches approximately 2.1 mrd. The same colour
# therefore denotes a different pole density in each panel. Nothing in the
# maps alone warns about that mismatch.
#
# ## Use one range for one figure
#
# `colorRange='equal'` chooses the smallest common range containing the
# tight range of every axis in the figure.

# %%
plot(pf, colorRange='equal')
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# One colour bar now serves the figure, and both panels run to approximately
# 3.5 mrd. The $(111)$ panel is visibly paler. The common range reveals its
# lower density, which the separate tight ranges hid.
#
# ## Fix one range across separate figures
#
# Separate figures cannot discover each other's limits. State the same
# numerical range in each plotting command. Here the original ODF and a
# mixture containing half uniform ODF both use the interval from 0 to 4 mrd.

# %% [markdown]
# Mixing with the uniform ODF halves the density contrast above 1 mrd.
# Because the figures share a range, the second texture looks weaker. Tight
# ranges would map these two affinely related fields to the same colours and
# make them look identical.
#
# ## Use explicit contour levels
#
# A contour level is a value at which a contour line or colour boundary is
# drawn. Explicit levels take the place of an explicit colour range for a
# contour plot. Reusing the levels makes separate contour plots comparable.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Change the range after plotting
#
# [setColorRange](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/setColorRange.html) adjusts a figure that has already
# been drawn. This is convenient when the useful limits become clear only
# after inspecting the data.

# %%
setColorRange([0.38, 3.9])

# %% [markdown]
# The colour bar now spans 0.38 to 3.9 mrd. Values outside that interval use
# an end colour. Existing contour boundaries stay at their original levels;
# changing the colour range does not recompute the contours.
#
# ## Use a logarithmic scale
#
# A sharp texture puts most values near zero and a few at much larger
# values. A linear scale can then show one small bright area against an
# almost empty background. `logarithmic` spreads the positive low values
# across more colours. Its lower colour-range limit must be positive.

# %%

mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# Weak parts of the pole figures now show structure. The colour bar is no
# longer linear, so equal distances in colour no longer represent equal
# differences in density. That loss of linear distance is the trade-off for
# making weak structure visible.
#
# ## Choose a colormap
#
# A colormap is the ordered set of colours assigned across the colour range.
# [mtexColorMap](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/mtexColorMap.html) sets it for a figure. MTEX supplies
# `white2black`, `blue2red`, and `LaboTeX` in addition to matplotlib's colormaps.

# %%
plotPF(odf, [Miller(1, 0, 0, cs), Miller(1, 1, 1, cs)], antipodal=True)
mtexColorMap('white2black')
mtexColorbar()

# %% [markdown]
# Colormap choice is not decoration. A monotone map such as `white2black`
# is an honest default for a density, which has no natural middle. A
# diverging map such as `blue2red` suits a quantity with a meaningful middle,
# such as signed curvature or the difference between two pole figures. Its
# neutral colour lies at the middle of the range. Set that range symmetrically,
# or the neutral colour marks a meaningless value.
#
# ## Use different colormaps in one figure
#
# Without an axes handle, `mtexColorMap` changes every axis in the figure.
# Pass an axes handle to colour only that axis. Independent colormaps are
# appropriate when the axes show different quantities rather than repeated
# views of one quantity.

# %% [markdown]
# These are three plots of the same random directions, yet each colormap
# gives a different visual impression. Independent colormaps need one colour
# bar each, which is what `'multiple'` asks for. A single bar carries one
# colormap and would describe only one of the three axes. That is the cost
# of using several colour mappings in one figure.

#
# MATLAB draws the markers of `plot(pf)` in its default `parula` map; the port uses MTEX's
# `WhiteJet` for every plot coloured by values. The 100 random directions of the last figure
# are not MATLAB's.
