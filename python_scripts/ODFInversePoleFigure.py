# # Inverse Pole Figures of an ODF
#
# A [pole figure](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFPoleFigure_py.html) fixes a crystal direction and asks where it points
# in the specimen. An *inverse pole figure* fixes a specimen direction $\vec r$ and asks
# which crystal directions $\vec h$ point along it.
#
# This page assumes the ODF and multiples-of-a-random-distribution (mrd) normalization
# from [ODF Theory](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ODFTheory_py.html). Crystal directions are introduced in
# [Crystal Directions](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/CrystalDirections_py.html). The projection itself is introduced in
# [Spherical Projections](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SphericalProjections_py.html).
# [Inverse Pole Figures](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationInversePoleFigure_py.html) builds the same construction
# first for individual orientations rather than an ODF.
#
# Formally, the inverse pole density is the ODF integrated along every orientation that
# maps $\vec h$ onto $\vec r$,
#
# $$ P_{\vec r}(\vec h) = \int_{g \vec h = \vec r} f(g)\, \mathrm{d}g. $$
#
# These orientations form an [orientation fibre](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFibre_py.html). The plot
# therefore loses the rotation about the aligned direction. Here _inverse_ means that the
# specimen and crystal directions exchange roles; it does not mean reconstructing or
# numerically inverting the ODF.
#
# The result is a density in mrd, not a percentage at one point. Inverse pole figures are
# natural when one specimen direction carries the physical question: a sheet normal, a
# compression axis, or an EBSD map surface normal.
#
# A *plotting convention* states how a reference frame is laid out on screen. The
# following convention draws specimen Y upward and specimen X to the right. It does not
# rotate the specimen or change the ODF.

# ## A Model Texture to Look At
#
# This is the same three-component texture as on the pole-figure page. It combines two
# localized components with a fibre component that aligns the crystal c-axis with
# specimen X.

# %%
cs = crystalFrame('32')
mod1 = orientation.byEuler(90 * degree, 40 * degree, 110 * degree, 'ZYZ', cs)
mod2 = orientation.byEuler(50 * degree, 30 * degree, -30 * degree, 'ZYZ', cs)

odf = 0.2 * unimodalODF(mod1) + 0.3 * unimodalODF(mod2) + 0.5 * fibreODF(Miller(0, 0, 1, cs), vector3d.X, halfwidth=10 * degree)

# convert once so repeated Radon transforms reuse Fourier coefficients
odf = SO3FunHarmonic(odf, bandwidth=32)

# ## Plotting Specimen Directions
#
# [plotIPF](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.plotIPDF.html) works like `plotPF`, except that its input directions
# belong to the specimen frame. The coordinates inside each panel are crystal directions.
# This frame reversal is the point of an inverse pole figure.

# %%
plotIPF(odf, cat(vector3d.X, vector3d.Z))
mtexColorMap('LaboTeX')
mtexColorbar(title='mrd')

# %% [markdown]
# The fibre component puts the c-axis along X, so the $(0001)$ corner is the maximum of
# the X inverse pole figure. The same corner is almost empty for Z. One inverse pole
# figure still does not determine full orientations, because every value collects an
# entire orientation fibre.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Values Rather Than Colours
#
# [radon](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SO3Fun.calcPDF.html) with only a specimen direction, `r=`, returns an
# inverse pole density function. Its printed summary identifies the returned
# spherical-function representation and crystal symmetry.

# %%
ipdfX = radon(odf, r=vector3d.X)
ipdfZ = radon(odf, r=vector3d.Z)

densitySummary = np.array([[ipdfX.eval(cs.cAxis), ipdfZ.eval(cs.cAxis)], [max(ipdfX)[0], max(ipdfZ)[0]]])
densitySummary

# %% [markdown]
# The first row is the density at $(0001)$: about 23 mrd for X and 0.021 mrd for Z. The
# second row contains the maxima. For X the c-axis corner is itself the maximum; for Z
# the maximum is about 5.2 mrd elsewhere in the sector. An inverse pole figure answers
# which crystal direction prefers one chosen specimen direction.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Antipodal Symmetry
#
# The `antipodal` flag identifies a crystal direction with its opposite. It replaces
# $P_{\vec r}(\vec h)$ by the average of its values at $\vec h$ and $-\vec h$. This
# halves the region that has to be drawn, exactly as for [axes](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/VectorsAxes_py.html). This
# is a modelling choice, not a display option. Use it only when the measurement or model
# cannot distinguish the directions.

# %%

# Notice both changes: the sector is smaller, and its colours can differ because
# opposite-direction densities have been averaged.

# ## The Complete Sphere
#
# By default MTEX draws only the [fundamental sector](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/FundamentalSector_py.html). Every
# point outside it is a symmetry-equivalent copy of one inside. The `complete` flag
# expands those copies, while `upper` retains only the upper hemisphere. Neither flag
# changes the density.

# %%

mtexColorMap('LaboTeX')

# The threefold symmetry of point group 32 is now visible as three repeats around the
# c-axis. They are symmetry-equivalent appearances of the same texture features, not
# three additional components.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Separating Symmetrization from the Displayed Region
#
# Keep the same complete upper hemisphere and impose antipodal symmetry. This isolates
# the change in density from the change in plotted region.

# %%
plotIPF(odf, cat(vector3d.X, vector3d.Z), complete=True, antipodal=True, upper=True)
mtexColorMap('LaboTeX')

# %% [markdown]
# The X plot gains three faint rim lobes from directions whose opposites were in the
# lower hemisphere. The localized Z lobes become broader averaged features. These changes
# come from the antipodal average, not from displaying a different part of the sphere.
#
# An inverse pole density of an ODF is not an EBSD colour key. A colour key assigns
# colours to the same crystal-direction sector but does not itself show how much material
# lies there.

# ## Technical Details
#
# MATLAB's empty crystal direction `[]` is `None` here: `calcPDF(odf, None, r)` returns
# the inverse pole density function. `max(ipdf)` returns the pair of the value and the
# direction, so the summary takes its first element.
