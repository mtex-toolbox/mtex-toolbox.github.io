# # Grain Orientation Parameters
#
# A reconstructed grain is represented by the orientations measured at all of its EBSD
# points. Grain orientation parameters reduce that orientation cloud to three questions:
# where is its centre, how wide is it, and does it have a preferred direction of spread?
#
# | | | | |
# |---|---|---|---|
# | `meanOrientation` | mean orientation | `GOS` | grain orientation spread |
# | `GAM` | grain average misorientation | `GAX` | grain average misorientation axis |
#
# The last label is used inconsistently. This page does not average misorientation axes to
# obtain GAX. It fits a fibre to the orientation cloud and calls the result a *dispersion
# axis*.
#
# The example is a deformed ferrite map. It assumes familiarity with
# [grain reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html) and
# [misorientations](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/MisorientationTheory_py.html). See
# [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html) for the relation between a grain and its EBSD
# points.

# Select one grain by its map coordinates. Indexing the EBSD map with that grain follows
# `ebsd.grainId` and returns all measurements assigned to it.

# The summary reports how many orientations represent this grain. Their `mean` is the
# symmetry-aware centre of the cloud, not an arithmetic mean of Euler angles.

# `calcGrains` has already stored this result as `grains.meanOrientation`. There is no
# reason to compute it again.

# %%

plot(grains, meanColor, micronbar=False)

# %% [markdown]
# The map assigns one mean orientation colour to each grain. It therefore removes the
# within-grain colour gradients visible in the first map while preserving the orientation
# contrast between grains.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Deviation from the mean
#
# With one reference orientation per grain, every measurement can be described by how far
# it departs from that reference. The resulting misorientation is the grain reference
# orientation deviation, GROD.

# %%
mis2meanSelected = grainSel.meanOrientation.inv() * ori

# %% [markdown]
# `calcGROD` performs the same calculation for the whole map and uses the appropriate mean
# orientation for each grain ID.

# %%
mis2mean = calcGROD(ebsd, grains)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Grain orientation spread
#
# A misorientation has an angle and an axis. Averaging only the GROD angle over a grain
# gives the grain orientation spread, GOS. `grainMean` averages any per-measurement
# quantity over grains.

# %%
# average the GROD angles for each grain
GOS = grainMean(ebsd, mis2mean.angle(), grains)

# plot the result in degrees
plot(grains, GOS / degree, micronbar=False)
mtexColorbar(title='GOS in degree')

# %% [markdown]
# Grains that are internally uniform are dark. Grains with a larger orientation gradient
# stand out, but GOS alone does not reveal the shape or direction of that gradient.
#
# The same value is available as `grains.GOS` because `calcGrains` computed it from the
# orientations used for reconstruction. If the orientations are subsequently denoised or
# otherwise changed, recompute GROD and GOS instead of treating the stored value as
# updated.
#
# `grainMean` accepts a function as a further argument. Using `np.max` gives the largest
# deviation in each grain rather than the average. A median, a quantile, or another
# statistic can be used in the same way.

# %%
# compute the maximum GROD angle for each grain
MGOS = grainMean(ebsd, mis2mean.angle(), grains, np.max)

# plot it
plot(grains, MGOS / degree, micronbar=False)

# %% [markdown]
# The maximum map emphasizes isolated peaks and sharp internal changes. The GOS map is
# less sensitive to one extreme measurement because it averages over the whole grain.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Grain average misorientation
#
# GOS compares every measurement with the mean of its grain. It therefore grows with the
# total orientation change across a large grain, even when the change is gentle.
#
# The grain average misorientation, GAM, asks a local question instead. It is the
# [kernel average misorientation](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDKAM_py.html) averaged over each grain. The default KAM
# compares first-order neighbours, applies no angle threshold, and does not cross
# reconstructed grain boundaries when `ebsd.grainId` is present.

# %%
kam = ebsd.KAM()
gam = grainMean(ebsd, kam, grains)

plot(grains, gam / degree, micronbar=False)
mtexColorbar(title='GAM in degree')
setColorRange([0, 3])

# %% [markdown]
# The GOS and GAM maps do not agree, and they are not meant to. GOS measures the total
# orientation change across a grain, whereas GAM measures the mean steepness of the local
# changes. A grain bent smoothly from one side to the other can have high GOS and low GAM.
# A subgrain boundary can instead produce high GAM. The two measures are regularly
# confused in the literature.
#
# Neither quantity is a direct strain or dislocation-density measurement. Segmentation,
# grain size, scan step, angular precision, denoising, and the KAM neighbourhood all
# affect the result. Report those choices whenever GOS or GAM is compared between maps.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The crystal dispersion axis
#
# Slip on one dominant system can spread the orientations of a grain along a curve rather
# than equally in every direction. Such a curve is an
# [orientation fibre](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/OrientationFibre_py.html). Its axis may constrain the slip system that
# produced the orientation gradient.
#
# `fibre.fit` finds the fibre that best fits a list of orientations. It always returns a
# fibre, even for a round cloud, so the fit must be checked before its axis is
# interpreted.

# The accepted axes still fill much of the projection, but the distribution is not

# population along X rather than one axis shared by every grain, and it does not form a
# girdle. A flow interpretation also requires the independently established specimen and
# kinematic frames. This example is ferritic steel rather than a shear-zone rock, so the
# geological kinematic patterns above are possibilities, not ground truth.

# ## The definitions
#
# Let $o_{g,i}$ be measurement $i$ in grain $g$, and let $\overline{o}_g$ be the
# symmetry-aware mean orientation of that grain. MTEX chooses the symmetrically equivalent
# misorientation with the smallest angle when it computes
#
# $$ \mathrm{GROD}_{g,i} = \mathrm{inv}(\overline{o}_g)\,o_{g,i}. $$
#
# For $N_g$ measurements in the grain, the scalar summaries are
#
# $$ \mathrm{GOS}_g = \frac{1}{N_g}\sum_i \angle(\mathrm{GROD}_{g,i}), $$
#
# $$ \mathrm{GAM}_g = \frac{1}{N_g}\sum_i \mathrm{KAM}_{g,i}. $$
#
# The neighbour definition inside KAM and the reference orientation inside GROD are
# therefore part of the definitions, not plotting options.

# ## Technical details
#
# Two small unindexed regions survive the closing here where MATLAB absorbs them, so the
# grains are restricted to the indexed ones before the mean orientations are coloured.
# `fibre.fit(ori, 'local', diagnostics=True)` returns MATLAB's triple; the eigenvalues are
# `lam[0]` to `lam[3]`, so MATLAB's `lambda(2)` and `lambda(3)` read `lam[:, 1]` and
# `lam[:, 2]` here. `calcGrains` writes the grain ids into the map and
# `ebsd.projectIntoFundamentalRegion()` returns a new map. The measurements the closing
# absorbed keep their `notIndexed` phase and carry no orientation, so the fit and the
# distances skip them. MATLAB's `table` is a printed line.
