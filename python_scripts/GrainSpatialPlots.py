# # Plotting Grains
#
# MTEX represents a grain as a phase-homogeneous, spatially connected region of EBSD pixels
# produced by segmentation. For plotting, its outline is a polygon whose fill colour can
# come from the phase, the mean orientation, or one number computed for that grain.
#
# This page assumes that you have reconstructed grains as described in
# [Grain Reconstruction](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainReconstruction_py.html). If inverse pole figure colours are new
# to you, read [IPF Maps](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EBSDIPFMap_py.html) first.
#
# A grain map differs from an EBSD map in one important way. An EBSD map has one colour
# per measurement, whereas a grain map has one colour per grain. It therefore shows the
# result of the reconstruction and none of the orientation scatter or
# measurement-to-measurement noise inside a grain.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Phase maps
#
# Called with no second argument, `plot` colours each grain by its phase. The colour is
# stored with the crystal symmetry of that phase.

# %%
plot(grains)

# %% [markdown]
# The phase colour can be changed, which is the simplest way to make one phase stand out.
# Only the forsterite grains change from blue to salmon; the enstatite and diopside colours
# stay as they were.

# %%
grains['Fo'].CS.color = "salmon"
plot(grains)

# %% [markdown]
# A single grain, or any subset, can instead be given its own colour with `faceColor`.
# Here the largest grain is filled in grey and made partly transparent, so its boundary
# and the phase map below remain visible.

# %%
# detect the largest grain
id = np.argmax(grains.area)

hold(True)
plot(grains[id], faceColor='darkgray', alpha=0.7)
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Orientation maps
#
# Passing the mean orientations as the second argument applies an inverse pole figure
# colour key. The key maps a chosen specimen direction into a crystal direction and assigns
# that crystal direction a colour. Each phase has its own symmetry and therefore needs its
# own key, so this is done one phase at a time.

# %%
plot(grains['Fo'], grains['Fo'].meanOrientation)

# %% [markdown]
# MTEX chooses the specimen z direction for this implicit form and reports the standard
# colour key in an interactive session. To choose the direction yourself, construct an
# `ipfColorKey` and ask it for the colours explicitly.

# %%
# a colour key for the forsterite phase
ipfKey = ipfColorKey(grains['Fo'])

# colour by which crystal direction points along specimen x
ipfKey.ipfDirection = vector3d.X

color = ipfKey.orientation2color(grains['Fo'].meanOrientation)
plot(grains['Fo'], color)

# %% [markdown]
# The map has changed completely although the orientations have not. What the colours
# mean is stored in the key, which should accompany every such map.

# %%
plot(ipfKey)

# %% [markdown]
# Red is [001], green is [100], and blue is [010]. A red grain in the map above therefore
# has its [001] axis close to specimen x. In the preceding map, where the implicit key used
# specimen z, red meant [001] close to z. A colour has no crystallographic meaning without
# the key that produced it.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Colouring by a grain property
#
# A numeric second argument must contain one value per grain. The colormap turns those
# values into colours. Here the value is the `aspectRatio`, the length-to-width ratio of
# the moment-equivalent ellipse fitted to the grain in this two-dimensional section.

# %%
plot(grains, grains.aspectRatio())
mtexColorbar(title='aspect ratio')

# %% [markdown]
# Almost the whole map sits at the bottom of the colour range because a few ribbon-shaped
# grains reach an aspect ratio of 13 and stretch it. Fixing the range to the interval of
# interest makes the other grains visible.

# %%
setColorRange([1, 5])

maxAspectRatio = max(grains.aspectRatio())
maxAspectRatio

# %%
numClipped = np.count_nonzero(grains.aspectRatio() > 5)
numClipped

# %% [markdown]
# The printed maximum rounds to 13, and the count confirms that eight grains lie above the
# chosen range. They are no longer distinguishable from one another, so every fixed colour
# range trades detail in the extremes for contrast through the rest.
#
# These shape values describe the observed section, not the full grain in three
# dimensions. A grain cut by the map edge is truncated as well, so remove `isBoundary`
# grains before calculating shape statistics. The map above keeps them because its purpose
# is display.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Averaging a measurement property over grains
#
# An EBSD property has one value per measurement and cannot be passed directly to a grain
# plot. `grainMean` reduces it to one value per grain. Here it averages the band contrast, a
# measure of diffraction-pattern quality, over the measurements assigned to each grain.

# %%
meanBandContrast = grainMean(ebsd, ebsd.bc, grains)

plot(grains, meanBandContrast)
mtexColorbar(title='mean band contrast')

# %% [markdown]
# Every polygon now has a uniform fill. The pixel-scale variation of band contrast is
# gone, and each colour represents the mean for one reconstructed grain. Other reductions,
# such as `np.max`, can be passed to `grainMean` when the mean is not the quantity of
# interest.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Colouring a direction
#
# An angle needs a colormap that closes on itself. The long axis of a grain is an axis
# rather than a directed vector: 0 and 180 degrees describe the same alignment and must
# receive the same colour, or the map shows a seam where there is none.

# %%
# consider only elongated grains away from the map edge
elongatedGrains = grains[(grains.aspectRatio() > 1.2) & ~grains.isBoundary]

# angle of the long axis to specimen x, measured about the section normal
omega = angle(vector3d.X, elongatedGrains.longAxis(), grains.N)

plot(elongatedGrains, omega / degree, micronbar=False)

# use a cyclic colormap and show its scale
mtexColorMap('twilight')
mtexColorbar(title='long-axis angle in degrees')

fractionInBand = np.mean((omega >= 60 * degree) & (omega <= 105 * degree))
fractionInBand

# %% [markdown]
# Grains of the same colour are aligned in the same way, and green dominates the map in
# MATLAB's cyclic map, the violet here. The printed fraction is close to one half: that
# many elongated interior grains lie between 60 and 105 degrees from specimen x, which is
# close to vertical in this plotting convention. The shapes say the same thing at a glance,
# and this clustering is the visual signature of a shape preferred orientation.
#
# This map is a diagnostic rather than a complete fabric analysis. A quantitative analysis
# should also decide how grains are weighted and whether phases are compared separately;
# [Ellipse Based Shape Parameters](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/EllipseBasedParameters_py.html) develops those choices.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Colouring by two properties at once
#
# The long axis of a nearly round grain is arbitrary. The previous map gives the same
# visual weight to a direction that is well defined and to one that is not. A
# `planarColorKey` maps one property to hue and a second one to saturation: direction
# becomes the colour, and aspect ratio controls how strongly that colour is shown.

# %%
# hue from a cyclic colormap, periodic because the long axis is an axis
pK = planarColorKey('twilight')
pK.periode = np.pi

# aspect ratio 1 fades to white, which reads as pale grey beside the outlines
# aspect ratio 3 and above is fully saturated
pK.range2 = [1, 3]

prop1 = angle(vector3d.X, grains.longAxis(), grains.N)
prop2 = grains.aspectRatio()

colors = pK.property2color(prop1, prop2)
plot(grains, colors)

# %% [markdown]
# The round grains have faded to nearly white, and only the elongated ones still carry a
# strong direction colour. The eye is no longer drawn to angles that have little meaning.
# The key itself can include the observed data range, so the reader can see which
# combinations occur.

# %%
pK.label1 = 'long-axis angle'
pK.label2 = 'aspect ratio'

plot(pK, prop1 / degree, prop2)

# %% [markdown]
# Any pair of scalar grain properties can be combined in this way, provided the hue and
# saturation assignments are stated with the map.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The measurements inside a grain
#
# A grain map hides the scatter within a grain by construction. To recover it, return to
# the measurements. The `grainId` property written into the map by `calcGrains` ties every
# measurement to a grain.

# %%
# the largest grain
id = np.argmax(grains.area)

# the measurements inside it
ebsdMaxGrain = ebsd[ebsd.grainId == grains.id[id]]

# the shorter form returns the same subset and displays its summary
ebsdMaxGrain = ebsd[grains[id]]
ebsdMaxGrain

# %% [markdown]
# Colouring the measurements with the same key puts them and the grain map on the same
# scale.

# %%
color = ipfKey.orientation2color(ebsdMaxGrain.orientations)

plot(ebsdMaxGrain, color, micronbar=False)

hold(True)
plot(grains[id].boundary, lineWidth=2)
hold(False)

maxDeparture = max(angle(grains[id].meanOrientation, ebsdMaxGrain['indexed'].orientations)) / degree
maxDeparture

# %% [markdown]
# Most of the 3193 measurements in the displayed summary have the same shade of blue. The
# narrow neck on the left is visibly lighter: its lattice is bent, and the printed maximum
# departure from the grain mean is 6 degrees.
# [Orientation Parameters](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/GrainOrientationParameters_py.html) measures this variation rather
# than relying on the colour difference alone.
#
# Before reconstruction, the scattered white pixels had phase `notIndexed` because their
# diffraction patterns could not be indexed. The `alpha` closing absorbed them into the
# surrounding grain. They keep that phase and have no orientation to draw. The white bay
# in the middle is different: the outline is one closed loop that bends around it, so the
# bay lies outside the grain. A neighbouring forsterite grain fills it and touches this
# grain from the outside.

# ## Arrows on grains
#
# A direction attached to each grain is often clearer as an arrow. `quiver` places one at
# every grain centroid.

# %%
# load a single-phase data set
plottingConvention.default('y↓→x')
ebsd = mtexdata('csl')

grains = calcGrains(ebsd, minPixel=5)
grains = smoothBoundary(grains, 5)
plot(grains, grains.meanOrientation, micronbar=False, region=[50, 300, 100, 250], ipfDirection=zvector)

# where one representative of the [100] family points in each grain
dir = grains.meanOrientation * Miller(1, 0, 0, grains.CS)

hold(True)
quiver(grains, dir, color='black')
hold(False)

# %% [markdown]
# Each arrow is that [100] representative seen from above and is drawn one fifth of its
# grain's diameter long. In cubic iron, the [100]-type directions are symmetry-equivalent.
# This example therefore demonstrates the arrow geometry rather than identifying one unique
# material direction.
#
# Arrow length otherwise carries no information except projection. An arrow appears short
# when it points steeply out of the section plane. Pass `scaling=False` when the vector
# magnitudes should set the lengths instead.
#
# An arrow pointing into the screen would be hidden below the map, so MTEX draws it tail
# first, ending at the grain centre. The small dot marks the centre to which it belongs.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Labelling grains
#
# `text` writes an arbitrary string at the same centroid. Labelling every grain is
# unreadable, so this is normally done for a selection. Here the grains larger than 100
# pixels are labelled by id.

# %%
plot(grains, grains.meanOrientation, micronbar=False, region=[50, 300, 100, 250], ipfDirection=zvector)

bigGrains = grains[grains.numPixel > 100]

text(bigGrains, bigGrains.id)

# %% [markdown]
# These ids are persistent grain identifiers, not necessarily positions in a subset.
# [Selecting Grains](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SelectingGrains_py.html) explains the distinction and uses them to
# recover individual grains and their measurements.

# ## Technical details
#
# The shape parameters are methods with parentheses, `grains.aspectRatio()`,
# `grains.longAxis()`, as MATLAB implements them as methods. The cyclic colour map is
# matplotlib's `twilight` where MATLAB uses `colorcet('C2')`, so the hues of the two
# direction maps differ while their structure is the same. `planarColorKey` wraps a
# periodic property modulo its `periode` before the hue lookup; MATLAB scales it by the
# largest value in the data, which coincides on a full turn.
