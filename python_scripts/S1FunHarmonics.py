# # Fourier Series on the Circle
#
# A function on the circle assigns a value to an in-plane angle $\rho$. Its values repeat
# after $2\pi$, so it is a $2\pi$-periodic function. Geometrically, its domain is also called
# the one-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^1$ or the one-dimensional torus.
#
# The preceding [Spherical Harmonics](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/SphericalHarmonics_py.html) page introduced wave-like
# basis functions on the sphere. On the circle, only one integer mode remains, and the
# corresponding expansion is an ordinary Fourier series.
#
# MTEX uses functions on the circle whenever a scalar quantity depends on an in-plane angle.
# Typical examples are
#
# * angular density distributions of grain long axes or other in-plane shape directions,
# * distributions of grain-boundary segment directions, optionally weighted by their segment
#   lengths,
# * caliper and projection lengths as functions of the projection direction, and
# * azimuth-angle distributions of three-dimensional directions.
#
# ## Start from an explicit formula
#
# MTEX offers two complementary representations. An [S1FunHandle](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S1FunHandle.S1FunHandle.html)
# evaluates an explicit formula whenever a value is requested. An
# [S1FunHarmonic](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S1FunHarmonic.S1FunHarmonic.html) stores a finite set of Fourier
# coefficients.
#
# Begin with the formula
#
# $$ f(\rho)=1+\frac{1}{2}\cos(2\rho). $$
#
# Pass the Python function to `S1FunHandle`.

# shows angle on the horizontal axis.

# ## Read the two views
#
# The Cartesian view makes the two maxima over one full turn easy to count. The polar view
# makes their opposite in-plane directions visible. Both panels show the same function, and
# neither changes its representation.
#
# ## Construct a function from coefficients
#
# Within `S1FunHarmonic`, the `fhat` property stores coefficients from mode $-N$ through
# mode $N$. It therefore contains an odd number of entries, and the centre entry is the
# constant mode.
#
# As an example, the following Fourier coefficients describe the real-valued function
# $f(\rho)=4+\cos\rho+2\sin(2\rho)$.

# ## Read the coefficient example
#
# The two coefficients of magnitude $0.5$ form the cosine term. The outer imaginary
# coefficients form the sine term. A real-valued function has conjugate coefficients in
# opposite modes.
#
# The centre entry is the mean value. In the vector as written it is 4, which is confirmed
# by `coefficientMean`.
#
# ## Approximate a formula by a Fourier series
#
# Constructing an `S1FunHarmonic` from an `S1FunHandle` computes the Fourier coefficients.
# The `bandwidth` is the largest retained mode. A higher bandwidth generally improves the
# approximation but also increases the computational cost.
#
# Computations with bandwidth 1024 are still very fast in practice and usually provide a
# good approximation. The much smaller bandwidth 20 is already sufficient for the smooth
# function below.

# ## Read the approximation
#
# The solid formula and dashed Fourier approximation overlap throughout the circle. The
# printed maximum error on the check grid is about $10^{-14}$, so the remaining difference is
# at the scale of floating-point round-off.
#
# ## Fit values sampled at angles
#
# A function is often known only at a finite set of angles.
# [S1FunHarmonic.interpolate](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S1FunHarmonic.interpolate.html) constructs a periodic
# trigonometric polynomial from those samples. The result can be evaluated at arbitrary
# angles, plotted, differentiated, or used in later computations.
#
# The bandwidth sets the number of Fourier modes in the interpolation. It should be large
# enough to resolve the measured angular variation. An unnecessarily large bandwidth can
# introduce oscillations or amplify noise.

# ## Read the sampled-data fit
#
# The curve joins the angular trend and closes periodically between $2\pi$ and zero. The
# default regularisation leaves a maximum residual of about $3.4\cdot10^{-4}$ at these
# samples. Set bandwidth and regularisation deliberately when the data contain noise or
# sharp changes.
#
# ## Smooth small-scale oscillations
#
# A harmonic function obtained from measured or interpolated data can contain small-scale
# oscillations or noise. [smooth](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S1Fun.smooth.html) reduces those variations by
# convolution with an [S1DeLaValleePoussinKernel](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S1DeLaValleePoussinKernel.html).
#
# The kernel halfwidth sets the angular scale of the smoothing. A small halfwidth preserves
# more local detail. A larger halfwidth produces a smoother function.

# %%

# ## Read the smoothing result
#
# The original curve has fine ripples from modes 20 and 35. The smoothed curve suppresses
# those ripples while retaining the broad mode-one and mode-two variation. Smoothing changes
# the function, so the halfwidth should be reported with any derived peak direction or
# density.
#
# ## Compute integrals and extrema
#
# Standard operations apply directly to an `S1FunHarmonic`. Here `S1FH` is still the
# bandwidth-20 approximation of $\exp(\cos\rho)$. [mean](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S1Fun.mean.html) returns its mean
# value, while [sum](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/S1Fun.sum.html) returns its integral over the circle.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Read the operations
#
# The mean is about 1.2661, and the integral is about 7.9549. Their ratio is $2\pi$. The
# maximum is $\mathrm e$ at zero degrees, while the minimum is $\mathrm e^{-1}$ at 180
# degrees.
#
# ## Estimate a density from angular data
#
# Periodic functions also arise after density estimation from circular data. For example,
# `rho` is the azimuth angle of a three-dimensional direction. Passing these angles with the
# `periodic` option makes [calcDensity](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/calcDensity.html) return an `S1FunHarmonic`.

# ## Read the angular density
#
# The directions were sampled uniformly, so the density fluctuates around a flat value
# rather than forming a stable preferred direction. Its mean is one because `calcDensity`
# normalizes the periodic density. A pronounced reproducible peak would instead indicate a
# preferred azimuth.
#
# ## The maths behind the Fourier representation
#
# A $2\pi$-periodic function can be represented as a weighted sum of sines and cosines.
# MTEX uses the numerically convenient complex exponentials $\mathrm e^{-\mathrm i k\rho}$.
# A finite series of bandwidth $N$ is
#
# $$ f(\rho)=\sum_{k=-N}^{N}\hat f_k\,
# \mathrm e^{-\mathrm i k\rho}, \qquad \rho\in[0,2\pi). $$
#
# MTEX uses the coefficient convention
#
# $$ \hat f_k=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}f(\rho)\,
# \mathrm e^{\mathrm i k\rho}\,\mathrm d\rho. $$
#
# The constant coefficient $\hat f_0$ is therefore the mean value,
#
# $$ \operatorname{mean}(f)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}
# f(\rho)\,\mathrm d\rho. $$
#
# The integral returned by `sum` is
#
# $$ \operatorname{sum}(f)=\int_0^{2\pi}f(\rho)\,\mathrm d\rho
# =2\pi\,\operatorname{mean}(f). $$

# MATLAB's `subplot(1,2,1)` becomes a polar axes when a polar plot goes into it; with
# matplotlib the page asks for `projection='polar'`. The random directions are not seeded
# as MATLAB's `rng default`, so the density differs from MATLAB's in its fluctuations.
